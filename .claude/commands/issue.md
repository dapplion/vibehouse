# GitHub Issue Creation Task

You are creating a GitHub issue for the Lighthouse project.

## Required Reading

**Before creating an issue, read `.ai/ISSUES.md`** for issue and PR writing guidelines.

## Structure

1. **Description** (required)
   - First paragraph: problem and brief solution
   - Context about current behavior
   - Links to related issues, PRs, or specs
   - Technical and specific

2. **Steps to Resolve** (when applicable)
   - Present options and considerations
   - Don't be overly prescriptive
   - Mention relevant constraints

3. **Code References**
   - Use GitHub permalinks with commit hashes
   - Get hash: `git rev-parse unstable`

## Style

- Natural, concise, direct
- Avoid AI-sounding language
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Present trade-offs

## Labels to Suggest

- **Type**: bug, enhancement, optimization, code-quality
- **Component**: database, HTTP-API, fork-choice, beacon-processor
- **Effort**: good first issue, low-hanging-fruit, major-task

## Output

Provide the complete issue text ready to paste into GitHub.

## After Feedback

If the developer refines your issue/PR text or suggests a different format:

1. **Apply their feedback** to the current issue
2. **Offer to update docs** - Ask: "Should I update `.ai/ISSUES.md` to capture this preference?"
3. **Document patterns** the team prefers that aren't yet in the guidelines
