# Upstream Sync

## Objective
Stay current with upstream lighthouse fixes and improvements.

## Status: ONGOING

### Process
1. `git fetch upstream` — check for new commits
2. Categorize: security fix (immediate), bug fix (cherry-pick), feature (evaluate), refactor (if clean)
3. Test after every cherry-pick batch
4. Push and verify

### Upstream PRs to watch
- [#8806 - Gloas payload processing](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/8806)
- [#8815 - Proposer lookahead](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/8815)
- [#8807 - Inactivity scores ef tests](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/8807)
- [#8793 - Process health observation](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/8793)
- [#8786 - HTTP client user-agent](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/8786)

### Recent spec changes (consensus-specs) needing attention
- `06396308` — payload data availability vote (new `DATA_AVAILABILITY_TIMELY_THRESHOLD`) — **CONFIRMED GAP**: fork choice missing `payload_data_availability_vote` tracking. Currently piggybacks `blob_data_available` on `payload_revealed`. Spec has separate `Store.payload_data_availability_vote` dict, `is_payload_data_available()` function, and `should_extend_payload()` using `DATA_AVAILABILITY_TIMELY_THRESHOLD = PTC_SIZE // 2`. Not blocking devnet-0 self-build but needed for multi-client interop.
- `b3341d00` — check pending deposit before applying to builder — **ASSESSED**: our code already removed the incorrect `is_pending_validator` check (commit `0aeabc122`). Current routing logic matches spec.
- `40504e4c` — refactor builder deposit conditions in process_deposit_request — **ASSESSED**: current implementation matches refactored spec logic.
- `36a73141` — replace pubkey with validator_index in SignedExecutionProof — **ASSESSED**: our `SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope` already uses `builder_index` (u64).
- `278cbe7b` — add voluntary exit tests for builders — NOT YET ASSESSED
