# Spec Tests

## Objective
Run the latest consensus spec tests at all times. Track and fix failures.

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### Current results
- **78/78 ef_tests pass** (as of 2026-02-17)
- **136/136 mainnet ssz_static pass** (Fulu + Gloas DataColumnSidecar variants both pass)
- All gloas fork_choice_reorg tests pass (4 previously failing now pass)
- 40/40 gloas execution_payload envelope tests pass (process_execution_payload_envelope spec validation)
- 3 altair proposer_boost tests skipped as known upstream failures (sigp/lighthouse#8689)

### Tasks
- [ ] Audit spec test runner — understand download, cache, run flow
- [ ] Check which spec test version is currently pinned
- [ ] Update to latest spec test release when new ones drop
- [ ] Ensure all existing fork tests pass (phase0 through fulu)
- [ ] Add gloas test scaffolding: register fork, add handlers, wire new test types
- [ ] Set up CI job: download latest vectors, run all tests, fail on regression
- [ ] Create automated PR bot for new spec test releases

### Test categories
bls, epoch_processing, finality, fork, fork_choice, genesis, light_client, operations, random, rewards, sanity, ssz_static, transition

## Progress log

### 2026-02-17 — 78/78 passing (execution_payload envelope tests added)
- Added `ExecutionPayloadEnvelopeOp` test handler for gloas `process_execution_payload` spec tests
- These tests use `signed_envelope.ssz_snappy` (unlike pre-gloas which uses `body.ssz_snappy`)
- Implemented envelope signature verification in `process_execution_payload_envelope` using `execution_payload_envelope_signature_set`
- Handles `BUILDER_INDEX_SELF_BUILD` (u64::MAX): uses proposer's validator pubkey instead of builder registry
- 40 tests: 17 valid cases + 23 expected failures (wrong block hash, wrong slot, invalid signature, etc.)
- Test gated behind `#[cfg(not(feature = "fake_crypto"))]` — one test (`process_execution_payload_invalid_signature`) has missing `bls_setting` in upstream test vectors

### 2026-02-17 — 77/77 passing (DataColumnSidecar SSZ fixed)
- Implemented DataColumnSidecar superstruct with Fulu and Gloas variants
- Fulu variant: index, column, kzg_commitments, kzg_proofs, signed_block_header, kzg_commitments_inclusion_proof
- Gloas variant: index, column, kzg_proofs, slot, beacon_block_root (per spec change)
- Updated all field accesses across 29 files to use superstruct getter methods
- SSZ static test handler split into separate Fulu and Gloas handlers
- Commit: `b7ce41079`

### 2026-02-15 — 76/77 passing
- All gloas fork_choice_reorg tests fixed (root, payload_status model correct)
- Added known-failure skips for 3 altair tests (upstream also hasn't fixed)
- Commit: `3b677712a`

### 2026-02-14 — SSZ static pass
- 66/67 SSZ static tests pass, all gloas types pass
- 1 pre-existing failure: DataColumnSidecar (Gloas spec added `kzg_commitments` field)
- Added gloas fork filters, registered 15 new type_name entries
