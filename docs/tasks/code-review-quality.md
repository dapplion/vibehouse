# Code Review & Quality Improvement

## Goal
The loop has shipped a massive amount of code autonomously (100+ runs). Review the codebase for quality issues, technical debt, and correctness concerns that may have accumulated during rapid autonomous development.

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Audit & Inventory
- [x] Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -W clippy::all` and fix all warnings
- [x] Run `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` — fix any doc warnings
- [x] Identify dead code, unused imports, unreachable paths
- [x] Check for `unwrap()`/`expect()` in non-test code — replace with proper error handling
- [x] Look for `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, `fixme`, `hack` comments

### Phase 2: Architecture Review — DONE
- [x] Review public API surface — are things `pub` that shouldn't be?
- [x] Check module organization — any god-files that should be split?
- [x] Review error types — consistent error hierarchy? Good error messages?
- [x] Check for code duplication across Gloas fork variants
- [x] Review superstruct variant handling — any missing arms, fallthrough bugs?

### Phase 3: Correctness Deep-Dive — DONE
- [x] Cross-reference Gloas implementation against consensus-specs v1.7.0-alpha.2
- [x] Verify all spec constants match (domain types, config values, timing)
- [x] Review edge cases in state transitions — overflow, underflow, empty collections
- [x] Audit builder payment/withdrawal logic for economic bugs
- [x] Review fork choice weight calculations against spec

### Phase 4: Performance — DONE
- [x] Profile hot paths (state transition, block processing, attestation validation)
- [x] Check for unnecessary clones, allocations in tight loops
- [x] Review database access patterns — any N+1 queries?
- [x] Check serialization/deserialization efficiency

### Phase 5: Test Quality — DONE
- [x] Review test coverage gaps — which critical paths lack tests?
- [x] Check test assertions — are they testing the right things?
- [x] Look for flaky/non-deterministic tests
- [x] Ensure integration tests cover realistic scenarios

## Process
Each loop iteration should:
1. Pick one sub-task from the checklist above
2. Audit the relevant code
3. Fix issues found (with tests)
4. Commit fixes atomically
5. Document findings and decisions here

## Findings Log

### Run 217: unwrap/expect audit + todo/fixme/hack scan

**Scope**: Full codebase scan for `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, `FIXME`, `HACK` in production code.

**Results — todo/unimplemented**:
- Zero `todo!()` macros in production code
- Zero `unimplemented!()` in production code (all in `#[cfg(test)]` mock trait impls)

**Results — FIXME/HACK** (all pre-existing, inherited from Lighthouse):
- `task_executor/src/lib.rs:87` — dead `service_name` field. Removing would be noisy (touches many callers), low value.
- `slasher/src/database/lmdb_impl.rs:168` — LMDB bindings bug workaround. Intentional.
- `lighthouse_validator_store/src/lib.rs:188` — `clippy::await_holding_lock` suppression pending async lock refactor. Known tech debt.
- `types/src/chain_spec.rs:1726` — `skip_serializing` hack for blob schedule. Can remove after Fulu is live.
- `operation_pool/src/lib.rs:286` — Electra cross-committee aggregation. Needs cleaner design but works correctly.
- `lighthouse/src/main.rs:84` — build profile name extraction from OUT_DIR. Intentional pattern.
- `network_utils/src/unused_port.rs:44` — port allocation with inherent TOCTOU. Known, acceptable for testing utility.

**Results — unwrap/expect in production code**:
- All Gloas consensus code (state_processing, envelope_processing, fork_choice, block_verification) is clean — uses `?` and `map_err` throughout.
- `beacon_chain.rs:7048` — `Signature::infinity().expect(...)` in self-build block production. **Fixed**: replaced with `map_err` + `?` propagation via `BlockProductionError::InvalidBlockVariant`.
- `proto_array_fork_choice.rs:1125` — `.unwrap()` on `max_by()` in head selection. **Safe**: guarded by `children.is_empty()` check 3 lines above. Comment documents invariant.
- `custody_context.rs:319-453` — `.expect()` on `sampling_size_custody_groups()`. Currently infallible but fragile. Pre-existing, not Gloas-specific.
- `subnet_service/mod.rs:645,664` — `.expect("Waker has been set")` in `Stream::poll_next`. Safe by control flow. Pre-existing.
- `naive_aggregation_pool.rs:52-56` — `.expect()` in `TreeHash` impl. Safe (exact leaf count). Pre-existing.
- `chain_config.rs:27` — `.expect()` on static hex constant. Effectively infallible. Pre-existing.
- `beacon_chain.rs:8511-8616` — `dump_as_dot`/`dump_dot_file` debug utilities. Dead code, acceptable for diagnostics.

**Decision**: Fixed the one production unwrap in our Gloas code. All other findings are pre-existing Lighthouse patterns that are either safe by invariant or intentional. No action needed on those.

### Run 218: clippy audit + cargo doc warnings fix

**Scope**: Full `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` audit and `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`.

**Clippy results**: Zero warnings. Codebase is fully clippy-clean.

**Cargo doc results** — fixed all warnings across 79 files:
- **127 bare URLs** in doc comments wrapped in angle brackets (`<https://...>`) across 74 files
- **3 `[Gloas]` references** escaped as `\[Gloas\]` to prevent broken intra-doc links (fork_choice.rs)
- **21 `\`\`\`ignore` code blocks** changed to `\`\`\`text` for non-Rust content (ASCII diagrams, shell commands, directory trees) across 13 files
- **1 unclosed HTML tag** — `FixedBytes<N>` wrapped in backticks (fixed_bytes/src/lib.rs)
- **1 broken intra-doc link** — `[ChainSpec::compute_fork_digest]` changed to backtick-quoted (enr_fork_id.rs)
- **1 broken self-reference** — `[self::sampling_columns_for_epoch]` simplified (custody_context.rs)
- **1 broken link to private item** — `[ProtocolQuota]` changed to backtick-quoted (rpc/config.rs)
- **1 broken link to `Rpc`** — backtick-quoted (rpc/mod.rs)
- **2 broken bracket patterns** — `[5,13,21]` in hdiff.rs wrapped in backticks
- **2 bracket patterns** — `[tcp,udp,quic]` and `[tcp6,udp6,quic6]` escaped (enr_ext.rs)

**Result**: `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` passes with `-D warnings`. `cargo clippy` clean. 2417/2425 tests pass (8 web3signer timeouts are pre-existing infrastructure-dependent failures).

### Run 219: dead code audit + spec conformance review

**Scope**: Phase 1 dead code audit + Phase 3 partial correctness deep-dive.

**Dead code results**:
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations: ~60 instances found, ALL in pre-existing Lighthouse code or test infrastructure. Zero in Gloas-specific code.
- `#[allow(unused_imports)]`: 3 instances, all in macro-generated code in `signed_beacon_block.rs`. Pre-existing.
- All Gloas public functions (9 in `gloas.rs`, 1 in `envelope_processing.rs`, 1 in `per_epoch_processing/gloas.rs`, 13+ in `beacon_chain.rs`) verified as actively called in production code paths.
- No dead code found. Phase 1 complete.

**Spec conformance review — cross-referenced against consensus-specs/gloas**:

1. **`process_execution_payload_bid`** ✓ — matches spec: self-build validation (amount=0, G2_POINT_AT_INFINITY), builder active check, `can_builder_cover_bid` (MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT + pending), signature verification, blob commitment limit, slot/parent_hash/parent_root/prev_randao checks, pending payment recording at `SLOTS_PER_EPOCH + slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`, bid caching.

2. **`process_payload_attestation`** ✓ — matches spec: beacon_block_root == parent_root, slot+1 == state.slot, get_indexed_payload_attestation → is_valid_indexed_payload_attestation (sorted indices, non-empty, aggregate signature).

3. **`process_execution_payload_envelope`** ✓ — matches spec order exactly: (1) signature verification, (2) cache state root in block header, (3) verify beacon_block_root/slot, (4) verify committed_bid consistency (builder_index, prev_randao), (5) verify withdrawals hash, (6) verify gas_limit/block_hash/parent_hash/timestamp, (7) process execution requests, (8) queue builder payment, (9) set execution_payload_availability + update latest_block_hash, (10) verify state root.

4. **`process_builder_pending_payments`** ✓ — matches spec: quorum = per_slot_balance * numerator / denominator, check first SLOTS_PER_EPOCH payments against quorum, rotate second half to first half, clear second half.

5. **`get_ptc_committee`** ✓ — matches spec: seed = hash(get_seed + slot_bytes), concatenate all committees, compute_balance_weighted_selection with shuffle_indices=False.

6. **Fork choice `validate_on_attestation`** ✓ — matches spec Gloas additions: index must be 0 or 1 for Gloas blocks, same-slot must be index 0, index=1 requires payload_revealed.

7. **Fork choice `get_gloas_weight`** ✓ — matches spec: non-PENDING nodes at adjacent slot (slot+1==current) return 0, otherwise sum attestation scores + optional proposer boost.

8. **Fork choice `find_head_gloas`** ✓ — matches spec get_head: start at justified, loop picking max(weight, root, tiebreaker) from children.

9. **`process_withdrawals_gloas`** ✓ — matches spec order: (1) builder pending withdrawals capped at MAX-1, (2) partial validator withdrawals capped at MAX-1, (3) builder sweep capped at MAX-1, (4) validator sweep capped at MAX. All state updates (apply_withdrawals, update indices, store expected_withdrawals) verified correct.

**No spec divergences found.** All checked functions match the consensus-specs faithfully.

### Run 220: spec constants verification

**Scope**: Phase 3 sub-task — verify all Gloas spec constants match consensus-specs v1.7.0-alpha.2 (domain types, preset values, config values, timing parameters, fork versions).

**Method**: Fetched spec from `ethereum/consensus-specs/master` (beacon-chain.md, fork-choice.md, validator.md, presets/mainnet/gloas.yaml, presets/minimal/gloas.yaml, configs/mainnet.yaml) and cross-referenced against vibehouse codebase.

**Results — all constants verified correct**:

| Category | Constants Checked | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Domain types | DOMAIN_BEACON_BUILDER (0x0B), DOMAIN_PTC_ATTESTER (0x0C), DOMAIN_PROPOSER_PREFERENCES (0x0D) | ✓ |
| Index flags | BUILDER_INDEX_FLAG (2^40), BUILDER_INDEX_SELF_BUILD (UINT64_MAX) | ✓ |
| Builder params | payment threshold 6/10, withdrawal prefix 0x03, min withdrawability delay 64 epochs | ✓ |
| Preset (mainnet) | PTC_SIZE=512, MAX_PAYLOAD_ATTESTATIONS=4, BUILDER_REGISTRY_LIMIT=2^40, BUILDER_PENDING_WITHDRAWALS_LIMIT=2^20, MAX_BUILDERS_PER_WITHDRAWALS_SWEEP=2^14 | ✓ |
| Preset (minimal) | PTC_SIZE=2, MAX_PAYLOAD_ATTESTATIONS=4, MAX_BUILDERS_PER_WITHDRAWALS_SWEEP=16 | ✓ |
| Fork choice | PAYLOAD_TIMELY_THRESHOLD=PTC_SIZE//2 (>), DATA_AVAILABILITY_TIMELY_THRESHOLD=PTC_SIZE//2 (>), PayloadStatus enum (0/1/2) | ✓ |
| Timing BPS | attestation=2500, aggregate=5000, sync=2500, contribution=5000, payload_attestation=7500 | ✓ |
| Fork versions | mainnet [0x07,0,0,0], minimal [0x07,0,0,1], gnosis [0x07,0,0,0x64] | ✓ |
| Networking | MAX_REQUEST_PAYLOADS=128 | ✓ |
| Derived types | BuilderPendingPaymentsLimit (2*SLOTS_PER_EPOCH per spec), ProposerLookaheadSlots | ✓ |

**Bug found and fixed**:
- `GnosisEthSpec::MaxPayloadAttestations` was `U2` but the gnosis preset yaml and ChainSpec both say 4. This would have limited Gnosis Gloas blocks to 2 payload attestations instead of 4. **Fixed**: changed to `U4` in `eth_spec.rs:662`. All 711 types tests + 69 SSZ static EF tests pass.

### Run 221: architecture review — superstruct variants, code duplication, error types

**Scope**: Phase 2 sub-tasks: superstruct variant handling, code duplication across Gloas fork variants, error type consistency.

**Superstruct variant handling audit**:
- All primary superstruct types include Gloas variants (BeaconBlock, BeaconBlockBody, BeaconState, ExecutionPayload, ExecutionPayloadHeader, BuilderBid, SignedBeaconBlock, LightClientUpdate, LightClientHeader, LightClientBootstrap, DataColumnSidecar)
- All `ForkName` match expressions explicitly handle Gloas — no missing arms
- Intentional field omissions documented: `blob_kzg_commitments` removed from Gloas body (moved to bid), `execution_requests` removed (moved to envelope)
- Wildcard `_ =>` patterns audited — none silently catching Gloas in consensus-critical paths
- **No issues found.**

**Code duplication audit**:
- Superstruct deserialization arms (Fulu vs Gloas): identical logic but framework requires separate arms. Cannot consolidate — superstruct limitation.
- Test helpers (`make_gloas_state`/`make_fulu_state`): intentionally different (ePBS-specific fields).
- RPC protocol limits already correctly grouped: `Electra | Fulu | Gloas`.
- **No actionable duplication found.**

**Error type consistency audit**:
- `BeaconChainError::EnvelopeProcessingError(String)` was wrapping `state_processing::EnvelopeProcessingError` via `format!("{:?}", e)`, losing structured error information.
- **Fixed**: Split into two variants:
  - `EnvelopeProcessingError(EnvelopeProcessingError)` — wraps the structured state_processing error type directly
  - `EnvelopeError(String)` — for ad-hoc beacon_chain-level envelope errors (missing blocks, newPayload failures, etc.)
- The two `process_execution_payload_envelope` call sites now use `.map_err(Error::EnvelopeProcessingError)?` instead of `format!("{:?}", e)`
- Ad-hoc string errors (13 call sites) migrated to `EnvelopeError`
- `BlockProductionError::EnvelopeConstructionFailed(String)` kept as-is — mixed usage prevents clean migration
- All 285 Gloas beacon_chain tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean

**Phase 2 checklist update**:
- [x] Review superstruct variant handling — any missing arms, fallthrough bugs?
- [x] Check for code duplication across Gloas fork variants
- [x] Review error types — consistent error hierarchy? Good error messages?
- [x] Review public API surface — are things `pub` that shouldn't be?
- [x] Check module organization — any god-files that should be split?

### Run 222: module organization audit, public API surface, state transition edge cases

**Scope**: Phase 2 (module organization, public API surface) + Phase 3 (state transition edge cases). Completes both phases.

**Module organization audit — god-file analysis**:

Top files by line count:
| File | Lines | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `tests/gloas.rs` | 12,588 | Test file — large but splitting tests has limited benefit |
| `beacon_chain.rs` | 8,805 | Classic god-file, pre-existing. Hard to split (tightly coupled `self` methods) |
| `proto_array_fork_choice.rs` | 6,934 | Fork choice with ePBS additions. Pre-existing structure |
| `per_block_processing/gloas.rs` | 5,936 | ~1010 prod + ~4926 tests. Production code is well-organized into bid/attestation/withdrawal/utility groups |

**Decision**: No splits needed. The largest Gloas file (`per_block_processing/gloas.rs`) has only ~1010 lines of production code — the bulk is tests. The production functions group naturally (bid processing, payload attestations, withdrawals, builder utils). Splitting would create unnecessary indirection without improving readability. The pre-existing god-files (`beacon_chain.rs`, `proto_array_fork_choice.rs`) are inherited and not Gloas-specific.

**Public API surface audit**:

Audited all `pub` items in 5 Gloas files. Most are correctly `pub` — used by external crates (ef_tests, beacon_chain, http_api, network).

**Fixed — 2 functions downgraded to `pub(crate)`**:
- `get_pending_balance_to_withdraw_for_builder` in `per_block_processing/gloas.rs` — only used within `state_processing` crate (by `verify_exit.rs` and internal tests)
- `upgrade_state_to_gloas` in `upgrade/gloas.rs` — only called by `upgrade_to_gloas` in the same file

All other `pub` items verified as legitimately needed by external crates.

**State transition edge cases audit**:

Comprehensive audit of all Gloas code in `consensus/state_processing/src/` for:

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Arithmetic overflow/underflow | SAFE | All `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` use `safe_arith` (`safe_add`, `saturating_add`, `safe_div`, `safe_rem`, `safe_mul`) |
| Division by zero | SAFE | All divisors explicitly checked before use (`builders_count > 0`, `validators_len > 0`, `indices.is_empty()` guards) |
| Array indexing | SAFE | Uses `.get()` consistently instead of `[]` — never direct indexing |
| Empty collections | SAFE | Proper `.is_empty()` and `.last().map().unwrap_or()` patterns |
| Builder/validator index bounds | SAFE | Proactive validation with `.get()` + `.ok_or()` before access |
| Withdrawal index wrapping | SAFE | Uses `safe_rem()` for circular sweeps |
| Envelope payload/state consistency | SAFE | Verifies alignment before processing |

**No issues found.** The Gloas state transition code demonstrates consistently defensive programming — safe arithmetic, bounds checking, zero-divisor guards, and proper error propagation throughout.

**Phase 2 and Phase 3 are now complete.**

### Run 223: performance audit — hot paths, clones, allocations

**Scope**: Phase 4 sub-tasks: profile hot paths for unnecessary clones/allocations, review database access patterns, check serialization efficiency.

**Method**: Three parallel agent searches across state_processing (block/envelope/epoch), proto_array fork choice, and beacon_chain integration. Identified all `.clone()` calls in Gloas-specific code, categorized as necessary vs unnecessary.

**Fixed — 2 performance improvements in `process_withdrawals_gloas`**:

1. **`withdrawals.clone()` eliminated** (line 707): The entire `withdrawals` Vec was cloned to create `payload_expected_withdrawals` List, then used only for `.len()` and `.last()` comparison afterward. **Fix**: capture `withdrawals_len` and `last_validator_index` before consuming `withdrawals` by value into `List::new()`. Saves one full Vec clone per block.

2. **`builder_pending_withdrawals` reconstruction replaced with `pop_front`** (lines 715-722): Was cloning all remaining items via `.iter().skip(n).cloned().collect()` into a new Vec, then `List::new()`. **Fix**: use milhouse `List::pop_front()` for in-place removal (same method already used for `pending_partial_withdrawals` on line 729). Avoids heap allocation + element cloning.

**Audited but not changed (necessary clones or pre-existing patterns)**:

| Category | Finding | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `payment.withdrawal.clone()` (epoch processing) | Required — can't borrow `builder_pending_payments` and mutably push to `builder_pending_withdrawals` simultaneously | None (borrow checker constraint) |
| `new_balances.clone()` (find_head) | Required — `new_balances` is `&JustifiedBalances`, must clone to store | None (API constraint) |
| `bid.clone()` (apply_execution_bid) | Required — bid pool takes ownership, caller needs the value too | None |
| `get_best_bid().cloned()` | Required — returns owned value from locked pool | None |
| Proto_array child finding O(n) scan | Pre-existing algorithm, tree is pruned at finality (~few hundred nodes) | Future optimization opportunity |
| `Vec<&PublicKey>` in signature verification | Required by BLS API (`fast_aggregate_verify` takes `&[&PublicKey]`); blst also collects internally. PTC_SIZE=512 → 4KB | None |
| `compute_filtered_roots` HashSet | Required for O(1) lookup in `get_gloas_children` | None |
| Epoch processing rotation clones | Element-level clones for same-list src/dst copy, unavoidable with milhouse API | None |
| Beacon_chain envelope state clone | Required — must mutate state copy for envelope processing without affecting original | None |

**Database access patterns**: No N+1 queries found. State access in Gloas code goes through milhouse `List::get()` which is O(1) tree access. Validator lookups use `state.validators().get(i)` which is direct indexed. No unbounded queries.

**Serialization efficiency**: Gloas types use SSZ (via `ssz_derive`) throughout. No custom serialization. `tree_hash_root()` is called only where needed (signing roots, state roots). No unnecessary re-serialization.

**Test results**: 272/272 Gloas state_processing tests pass, 309/309 beacon_chain Gloas integration tests pass, EF spec withdrawal + sanity tests pass. Clippy clean.

### Run 224: test quality review — coverage, assertions, flakiness

**Scope**: Phase 5 — audit test coverage gaps, assertion quality, non-deterministic patterns, and integration test realism across all Gloas code.

**Method**: Three parallel agent searches across state_processing (175+ tests), beacon_chain integration (309+ tests), fork choice (51+ tests), HTTP API (39+ tests), and network processor (41+ Gloas tests).

**Coverage assessment — no gaps in Gloas-specific code**:

| Module | Tests | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `per_block_processing/gloas.rs` | ~91 | All 9 public functions tested with edge cases |
| `envelope_processing.rs` | ~28 | All validation paths + state mutations tested |
| `per_epoch_processing/gloas.rs` | ~21 | Quorum threshold boundaries, rotation mechanics |
| `upgrade/gloas.rs` | ~26 | Complete Fulu→Gloas migration coverage |
| `per_slot_processing.rs` (Gloas) | ~8 | Availability bit clearing + integration |
| `beacon_chain/tests/gloas.rs` | ~231 | Chain finalization, block production, envelope lifecycle |
| `gloas_verification.rs` tests | ~52 | Gossip validation for bids, attestations, envelopes |
| `proto_array` (Gloas) | ~51 | Head selection, weight, tiebreaker, payload status |
| `fork_choice` (Gloas) | ~18 | Attestation index validation, head payload status |
| HTTP API (Gloas) | ~39 | All Gloas endpoints: PTC duties, envelopes, bids, prefs |
| Network gossip (Gloas) | ~41 | Bid/envelope/attestation/preferences validation |

**Reported "gaps" assessed as non-issues**:

- `PayloadAttestationError::InvalidAggregationBits` — unreachable by construction (`BitVector<PtcSize>` is type-level fixed size, `get(i)` can't OOB when `i < PtcSize`)
- `PayloadAttestationError::PtcCommitteeError` — requires `get_ptc_committee()` internal failure, which would indicate a corrupted beacon state (not a gossip validation concern)
- Event subscription functions (`subscribe_execution_bid/payload_attestation`) — not consensus-critical, SSE event delivery infrastructure
- `get_parent_payload_status_of()`, `get_gloas_children()` — internal helpers thoroughly exercised by 14 head-selection integration tests

**Assertion quality assessment**:

| Module | Quality | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `envelope_processing.rs` tests | EXCELLENT | All tests assert specific state mutations (latest_block_hash, availability bits, balance changes, withdrawal queue contents) |
| `per_block_processing/gloas.rs` tests | GOOD | 239 `assert_eq!` for specific values, 31 `matches!` for error variants, only 1 bare `.is_ok()` |
| `beacon_chain/tests/gloas.rs` | ADEQUATE | Integration tests appropriately rely on chain success/failure; some could assert specific finalized epoch values but this is a style preference, not a bug |

**Flaky test assessment — no Gloas-specific flakiness**:

All timing-sensitive patterns found are in pre-existing inherited code:
- Network processor tests use `STANDARD_TIMEOUT = 10s` and `assert_event_journal_with_timeout()` — inherited from Lighthouse, not Gloas-specific
- `import_gossip_block_acceptably_early()` has a known race condition documented by original author — inherited
- `test_rpc_block_reprocessing()` uses fixed 4s delay + 30ms retry window — inherited

Gloas-specific tests are fully deterministic:
- State processing tests use direct function calls with constructed inputs, no timing
- Fork choice tests use mock slot clocks with explicit slot advancement
- Beacon chain integration tests use test harness with controlled slot progression
- The one Gloas timing test (`gloas_proposer_boost_four_interval_boundary`) uses the mock slot clock's `set_current_time()` — deterministic

**Integration test realism**:

The Gloas integration tests in `beacon_chain/tests/gloas.rs` cover realistic multi-block scenarios:
- Chain finalization through Gloas fork boundary (tests full lifecycle)
- Self-build block production with envelope processing
- External builder path with bid selection and envelope import
- Payload withholding (EMPTY path) and recovery
- Multi-epoch chains with attestation aggregation
- Fork choice head selection with PTC votes and proposer boost

These complement the devnet scenarios (kurtosis scripts) for end-to-end testing.

### Run 225: complete BlockProcessingError envelope error wrapping

**Scope**: Finish the error type improvement started in run 221. Run 221 fixed `BeaconChainError::EnvelopeProcessingError(String)` to wrap the structured type. This run fixes the same pattern in `BlockProcessingError::EnvelopeProcessingError(String)`.

**Changes**:
- `BlockProcessingError::EnvelopeProcessingError(String)` → `EnvelopeProcessingError(Box<EnvelopeProcessingError>)` — preserves structured error information for debugging
- Added `PartialEq` derive to `EnvelopeProcessingError` (required by `BlockProcessingError`'s existing `PartialEq` derive)
- Used `Box` to avoid infinite type recursion (`EnvelopeProcessingError` already contains `BlockProcessingError`)
- Updated 3 call sites: block_replayer (2) + ef_tests operations (1)

**Verification**: 452/452 state_processing tests, 138/138 EF spec tests (fake_crypto), 4/4 EF operations_execution_payload tests (real crypto), clippy clean (full workspace including tests).

**Conclusion**: Phase 5 complete. Gloas test quality is strong — comprehensive coverage, specific assertions, deterministic execution. No actionable gaps found that justify new tests. The codebase has ~600+ Gloas-specific tests across all layers.

### Run 294: withdrawal loop optimization, Copy derivation, saturating_sub simplification

**Scope**: Performance optimizations in Gloas withdrawal processing and builder payment types.

**Changes**:

1. **Hoisted `state.validators().len()` out of hot loops** in both `process_withdrawals_gloas` and `get_expected_withdrawals_gloas` — the validator count was called per-iteration in the validator sweep loop for the `safe_rem` modulus. Now cached before the loop. Affects both the mutation path and the read-only expected-withdrawals computation.

2. **Derived `Copy` on `BuilderPendingWithdrawal` and `BuilderPendingPayment`** — both types are small fixed-size structs (36 and 44 bytes respectively, all-Copy fields: `Address` + `u64` + `u64`). With `Copy`, all `.clone()` calls become zero-cost bitwise copies. Fixed 7 `clone_on_copy` clippy lints across production and test code (replaced `.clone()` with dereference or direct pass).

3. **Simplified `saturating_sub(min(amount, balance))`** to `saturating_sub(amount)` in builder withdrawal balance decrease — the `min` is redundant since `saturating_sub` already clamps to zero.

**Verification**: 463/463 state_processing tests, 711/711 types tests, 17/17 EF operations+sanity tests, 18/18 EF epoch processing tests, full workspace clippy clean.

### Run 299: execution payload envelope metrics

**Scope**: Observability improvement — add metrics for execution payload envelope gossip processing and self-build envelope processing.

**Problem**: Execution bids had 3 metrics (verified, imported, equivocating) and payload attestations had 3 metrics, but execution payload envelopes — the second half of the ePBS pipeline where builders reveal payloads — had zero metrics. Operators could not monitor envelope verification rates, rejection patterns, or import success rates.

**Changes**:
1. **Network gossip metrics** (3 new counters in `beacon_node/network/src/metrics.rs`):
   - `beacon_processor_payload_envelope_verified_total` — envelope passed gossip validation
   - `beacon_processor_payload_envelope_imported_total` — envelope fully processed (EL + state transition)
   - `beacon_processor_payload_envelope_rejected_total` — envelope rejected (InvalidSignature, SlotMismatch, BuilderIndexMismatch, BlockHashMismatch, NotGloasBlock)

2. **Beacon chain metric** (1 new counter in `beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/metrics.rs`):
   - `beacon_self_build_envelope_successes_total` — self-build envelope processed successfully

**Verification**: 44/44 Gloas network tests, 17/17 self-build envelope tests, 17/17 EF spec tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full passed).

### Run 556 — Dead V15 operation pool compat removal

**Problem**: `PersistedOperationPool` used a superstruct enum with V15 and V20 variants. The V15 variant was a compatibility shim for old Lighthouse DB schema ≤17. vibehouse has no production databases with old schemas, and no migration code references V15. Three `TransformPersist` impls for `AttesterSlashingBase` existed solely to support V15→V20 conversion.

**Changes**:
1. Converted `PersistedOperationPool` from a superstruct enum to a plain struct (136 lines removed)
2. Removed dead `TransformPersist` impl for `AttesterSlashingBase` and `From`/`TryFrom` for `SigVerifiedOp<AttesterSlashingBase>` (3 TODOs resolved)
3. Made `into_operation_pool` infallible (was `Result` only because V15 conversion could fail)
4. Removed `IncorrectOpPoolVariant` error variant (unused)

**Verification**: 31/31 operation_pool tests, schema_stability test, op pool retrieval tests all pass. Full workspace clippy clean.

### Run 557 — Dead V17 fork choice compat and all DB schema migrations removal

**Problem**: Fork choice persistence used superstruct enums with V17 and V28 variants across 3 crates (proto_array `SszContainer`, fork_choice `PersistedForkChoice`, beacon_chain `PersistedForkChoiceStore`/`PersistedForkChoice`). V17 was the format used by Lighthouse schemas 17–27; vibehouse has always been at schema 28. Six migration files (v22→v28, 1,068 lines) existed to upgrade old Lighthouse databases that vibehouse will never encounter. `CacheItem` and `BalancesCache` were single-variant superstructs (V8 only) — unnecessary abstraction.

**Changes** (1,522 lines removed, 32 added):
1. Deleted 6 migration files: `migration_schema_v23.rs` through `migration_schema_v28.rs`
2. Simplified `migrate_schema` to only accept identity (from == to == CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION)
3. Converted `SszContainer` (proto_array) from V17/V28 superstruct to plain struct
4. Converted `PersistedForkChoice` (fork_choice) from V17/V28 superstruct to plain struct
5. Converted `PersistedForkChoice` (beacon_chain) from V17/V28 superstruct to plain struct
6. Converted `PersistedForkChoiceStore` from V17/V28 superstruct to plain struct
7. Removed `from_persisted_v17()` and all V17↔V28 conversion impls
8. Converted `CacheItem`/`BalancesCache` from single-variant superstructs to plain structs
9. Removed 4 schema downgrade/upgrade round-trip tests (tested dead migration paths)

**Verification**: 277/277 proto_array + fork_choice tests, 8/8 EF fork choice tests, 31/31 operation_pool tests, schema_stability test passes. Full workspace clippy clean (lint-full passed).

### Run 558 — ProtoNode superstruct simplification + dead storage module removal

**ProtoNode simplification** (consensus/proto_array):
- `ProtoNode` used `#[superstruct(variants(V17), no_enum)]` with only one variant — all fields always present
- Converted to plain struct with `#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Debug, Encode, Decode, Serialize, Deserialize)]`
- Renamed `ProtoNodeV17` references to `ProtoNode` in ssz_container.rs
- Removed `superstruct` dependency from proto_array crate

**Dead storage modules removal** (beacon_node/store, 1,549 lines removed):
- `partial_beacon_state.rs` (510 lines) — pre-v22 format where beacon state vector fields were loaded lazily from chunked DB columns. Not imported by any production code.
- `chunked_vector.rs` (919 lines) — chunked storage format for state vectors (block_roots, state_roots, randao_mixes, etc.). Only used by partial_beacon_state.rs and chunked_iter.rs.
- `chunked_iter.rs` (120 lines) — iterator over chunked vector storage. Only used internally.
- Removed dead error types: `ChunkError`, `VectorChunkError`, `PartialBeaconStateError`
- Updated `compact()` and leveldb `compact_column()` to use active DB columns instead of deprecated `BeaconState`/`BeaconStateSummary`

**Not removed** (intentional design):
- `OnDiskStoreConfig` (V22 superstruct) — uses SSZ union encoding with version byte for forward-compatible serialization
- `HDiff` (V0 superstruct) — same SSZ union versioning pattern
- Deprecated DB column enum variants — harmless, needed for `key_size()` match exhaustiveness

**Verification**: 293/293 proto_array + fork_choice + store tests, 8/8 EF fork choice tests. Full workspace clippy clean (lint-full passed).

### Run 559 — Dead error variants and orphaned schema_change README

**Scope**: Continue dead code cleanup from runs 556-558. Remove never-constructed error enum variants and orphaned documentation.

**Changes**:

1. **proto_array error.rs** — removed 4 never-constructed variants:
   - `InvalidFinalizedRootChange` — 0 uses
   - `MissingJustifiedCheckpoint` — 0 uses
   - `MissingFinalizedCheckpoint` — 0 uses
   - `UnknownLatestValidAncestorHash` — 0 uses

2. **fork_choice error enum** — removed 2 dead variants:
   - `InvalidLegacyProtoArrayBytes` — V17 format removed in run 557, variant became dead
   - `AttemptToRevertJustification` — never constructed

3. **store errors.rs** — removed 3 never-constructed variants:
   - `RandaoMixOutOfBounds` — 0 uses
   - `GenesisStateUnknown` — 0 uses
   - `LoadHotStateSummaryForSplit` — 0 uses

4. **schema_change/README.md** — deleted orphaned README describing the old migration system removed in run 557. The `schema_change.rs` file (identity-check safety function) remains.

**Not changed (intentional)**:
- `OnDiskStoreConfig` V22 / `HDiff` V0 single-variant superstructs — SSZ union encoding with version byte for forward compatibility (run 558 decision)
- Deprecated `DBColumn` variants — needed for `key_size()` match exhaustiveness
- `BeaconChainError` variants — many appear unused but are constructed via `From` impls and `?` operator

**Verification**: 277/277 proto_array + fork_choice tests, 8/8 EF fork choice tests, 16/16 store tests. Full workspace clippy clean (lint-full passed).

### Run 560 — Unused dependency removal

**Scope**: Remove unused Cargo.toml dependencies identified by cargo-machete, with manual verification to filter out false positives (derive macros, feature forwarding, etc.).

**Changes** (6 dependencies removed across 5 crates):
1. `common/clap_utils` — removed `alloy-primitives` (no usage in crate)
2. `common/eth2` — removed `either` (no usage in crate). Kept `rand` (needed by `TestRandom` derive macro — cargo-machete false positive)
3. `validator_client/beacon_node_fallback` — removed `itertools` (no usage in crate)
4. `validator_client/lighthouse_validator_store` — removed `beacon_node_fallback`, `either`, `environment` (none used in crate)
5. `validator_client/validator_services` — removed `either` (no usage in crate)

**Also fixed**: pre-existing `cargo sort` issues in `beacon_chain/Cargo.toml` and `state_processing/Cargo.toml`.

**Not removed** (false positives):
- `consensus/merkle_proof` `alloy-primitives` — needed for feature forwarding (`arbitrary = ["alloy-primitives/arbitrary"]`)
- `common/eth2` `rand` — used by `TestRandom` derive macro
- All `ethereum_ssz`/`ethereum_ssz_derive`/`ethereum_serde_utils` — used by derive macros
- `lighthouse` `lighthouse_tracing`/`store` — actually imported in main.rs / used transitively
- `environment` `tracing-log` — used indirectly via logging crate

**Verification**: 98/98 tests across affected crates. Full workspace compiles clean, lint-full passes.

### Run 561 — More unused dependency removal

**Scope**: Second pass of cargo-machete with manual verification, focusing on non-derive-macro dependencies missed in run 560.

**Changes** (4 dependencies removed across 4 crates):
1. `consensus/state_processing` — removed `swap_or_not_shuffle` (0 uses in crate)
2. `consensus/fork_choice` — removed `superstruct` (0 uses after ProtoNode simplification in run 558)
3. `validator_client/slashing_protection` — removed `tracing` (0 uses in crate)
4. `common/logging` — removed `serde` (only `serde_json` is used, not `serde` itself)

**Not removed** (false positives, same as run 560):
- All `ethereum_ssz`/`ethereum_ssz_derive`/`ethereum_serde_utils` — used by derive macros
- `eth2` `rand` — used by `TestRandom` derive macro
- `merkle_proof`/`bls` `alloy-primitives` — feature forwarding
- `eth2_wallet` `tiny-bip39` — used via `bip39::` import

**Verification**: 724/724 tests across affected crates. Full workspace compiles clean, lint passes.

### Run 562 — Dead V22 compat code, orphaned file, dead error variants

**Scope**: Continue dead code cleanup. Remove code made dead by schema migration removal (run 557) and other never-used items.

**Changes**:

1. **Dead V22 state summary compat** (beacon_node/store/src/hot_cold_store.rs, 70 lines removed):
   - Removed `HotStateSummaryV22` struct + `StoreItem` impl (only used by dead fallback path)
   - Removed `load_hot_state_summary_v22()` function
   - Removed `load_block_root_from_summary_any_version()` function (V22 fallback path dead since migrations removed in run 557)
   - Simplified `load_split()` to use `load_hot_state_summary()` directly
   - Removed obsolete V22↔V24 migration scenario comment

2. **Orphaned file** (beacon_node/beacon_chain/src/otb_verification_service.rs, 369 lines removed):
   - File was never declared as `mod` in lib.rs — completely dead code
   - Contained `OptimisticTransitionBlock` verification service (deprecated feature)

4. **Cargo.lock sync** — updated for dependency removals from runs 560-561

**Not changed (intentional)**:
- `OnDiskStoreConfig::V22` superstruct — SSZ union encoding for forward compatibility (run 558 decision)
- Deprecated `DBColumn` variants — needed for `key_size()` match exhaustiveness
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` on error enum fields used in Debug impls — standard Rust pattern
- `GossipCacheBuilder` dead_code allow — builder pattern, methods available for future use

**Verification**: 557/557 state_processing tests, 16/16 store tests. Full workspace lint-full passes.

### Run 563 — Dead error variants in BeaconChainError and EpochProcessingError

**Scope**: Continue dead code cleanup. Remove never-constructed error enum variants across two crates.

   - `EpochProcessingError::InclusionError(InclusionError)` variant also removed (0 constructions)
   - `From<InclusionError> for EpochProcessingError` impl removed

**Not changed (intentional)**:
- Same items as run 562

**Verification**: 557/557 state_processing tests, 35/35 EF spec tests (epoch processing + operations + sanity). Full workspace lint-full passes.

### Run 564 — Dead error variants in engine_api, BeaconChainError, and BlockProductionError

**Scope**: Continue dead code cleanup across three error enums.

**Changes**:

1. **engine_api::Error** (beacon_node/execution_layer/src/engine_api.rs, 8 variants + 1 import removed):
   - `RequestFailed(String)` — 0 constructions within execution_layer

   - `KzgError(kzg::Error)` — 0 constructions

**Verification**: 557/557 state_processing tests, 16/16 store tests, 35/35 EF spec tests. Full workspace lint passes.

### Run 565 — Dead error variants in block processing, attestation, and network errors

**Scope**: Continue dead code cleanup across state_processing errors, BeaconChainError, and network sync errors.

**Changes**:

1. **BeaconChainError** (2 variants removed):
   - `ProcessInvalidExecutionPayload(JoinError)` — 0 constructions
   - `UnsupportedFork` — 0 constructions

2. **AttestationInvalid** (3 variants removed):

**Verification**: 557/557 state_processing tests, 35/35 EF spec tests, 163/163 network tests. Full workspace clippy clean.

### Run 566 — Final dead code sweep

**Scope**: Comprehensive dead code audit across remaining error enums, public functions, constants, and modules.

**Changes**:

1. **store::Error** (1 variant removed):
   - `MissingGenesisState` — 0 constructions anywhere in workspace

**Exhaustive audit results** (no further dead code found):
- All remaining error variants in store::Error, BeaconChainError, BlockProductionError, BlockProcessingError, all state_processing error enums, fork_choice::Error, network sync errors — all actively constructed
- All `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations justified (test infrastructure, Debug-used fields, Drop guards)
- All Gloas-specific public functions verified as actively called
- No orphaned .rs files, no dead modules, no unused re-exports
- `IndexedPayloadAttestation::num_attesters()` and `PayloadAttestation::num_attesters()` — only test usage, but harmless utility methods
- Consensus-specs still at v1.7.0-alpha.2, PTC Lookbehind PR #4979 still open, no spec logic changes merged

**Verification**: 16/16 store tests, full workspace build + clippy clean.

### Run 567 — Visibility audit: pub → pub(crate) downgrades

**Scope**: Audit all Gloas-specific `pub` items across state_processing and beacon_chain crates for unnecessary visibility.

**Method**: Grep every Gloas `pub fn`/`pub struct`/`pub enum` → check if used outside its crate (including integration tests in `tests/`).

**Changes** (2 functions downgraded):
1. `get_pending_balance_to_withdraw_for_builder` (gloas.rs:965) — `pub` → `pub(crate)`, only used within state_processing (verify_exit.rs, gloas.rs)
2. `initiate_builder_exit` (gloas.rs:990) — `pub` → `pub(crate)`, only used within state_processing (process_operations.rs)

**Investigated but kept as `pub`** (legitimately cross-crate):
- `process_execution_payload_bid` — used by beacon_chain, ef_tests
- `can_builder_cover_bid`, `get_ptc_committee`, `is_parent_block_full`, `get_expected_withdrawals_gloas`, `process_withdrawals_gloas` — all used by beacon_chain or ef_tests
- `process_builder_pending_payments` — used by ef_tests
- `VerifiedExecutionBid`, `VerifiedPayloadAttestation`, `VerifiedPayloadEnvelope` — used by network crate
- `ExecutionBidError`, `PayloadAttestationError`, `PayloadEnvelopeError` — used by http_api and network
- `ObservedExecutionBids`, `ObservedPayloadAttestations`, `ObservedPayloadEnvelopes`, `ExecutionBidPool` — exposed via `pub` fields on `BeaconChain`, accessed from http_api/network tests
- `BidObservationOutcome`, `AttestationObservationOutcome` — used within beacon_chain verification

**Verification**: 557/557 state_processing tests, zero warnings, clippy clean.

### Run 569 — dependency updates and codebase health check

**Scope**: Spec conformance check, dependency updates, dead code audit.

**Spec status**:
- v1.7.0-alpha.2 still latest release, no new spec test vectors
- PTC Lookbehind (PR #4979) still open/blocked
- No new Gloas-related PRs merged since run 568
- CI: all jobs green (check+clippy+fmt, ef-tests, network+op_pool passed; beacon_chain and http_api in progress)
- Nightly CI: 5 consecutive green runs (Mar 3-7)

**Dead code audit**: Comprehensive scan of `#[allow(dead_code)]`, unused imports, stale conditional compilation — all 21 instances are justified (error Debug fields, builder pattern methods, test infrastructure, platform-specific code). No cleanup needed.

**Dependency updates** (2 commits):
1. `procfs` 0.15.1 → 0.18.0 — removed 10 stale transitive deps (hermit-abi, io-lifetimes, linux-raw-sys 0.1.x, rustix 0.36.x, 6 windows-sys/targets crates)
2. `libc` 0.2.182 → 0.2.183 — patch update

**Investigated but not updated**:
- `psutil` 3.3.0 → 5.4.0: blocked by `darwin-libproc` → `memchr ~2.3` pin conflicting with `gossipsub` → `regex` → `memchr ^2.6`
- `cc` 1.2.30 → 1.2.56: breaks `leveldb-sys` build (adds `-Wthread-safety` GCC doesn't support)
- `cmake` 0.1.54 → 0.1.57: same `leveldb-sys` build failure
- `itertools`, `sysinfo`, `uuid`, `strum`: major version bumps requiring API migration across many crates, low value
- `service_name` dead field in TaskExecutor: 25+ callers, high churn for zero behavior change

**Verification**: 2585/2593 tests pass (8 web3signer timeouts — pre-existing infrastructure-dependent), zero clippy warnings, full lint clean.

### Run 571 — unused dependency cleanup (2026-03-08)

Removed 9 unused dependencies across 6 crates using `cargo-machete --with-metadata`:
- `bls`: removed `alloy-primitives`, `safe_arith`
- `execution_layer`: removed `sha2`
- `http_api`: removed `either`
- `slashing_protection`: removed `ethereum_serde_utils`
- `store`: removed `logging`, `smallvec`, `tracing-subscriber`
- `client`: removed `ethereum_ssz`

False positives from cargo-machete (kept): `rand` (used by TestRandom derive macro), `ethereum_ssz` (used by Encode/Decode derive macros), `zip` (build-dependency), `futures` (dev-dependency used in tests).

### Run 579 — dependency upgrades: db-key, headers (2026-03-08)

**Spec status**: v1.7.0-alpha.2 still latest release. PR #4950 (extend by_root serve range) and #4926 (SLOT_DURATION_MS) merged since last check — both already compliant, no code changes needed.

**Dependency upgrades** (2 crates):
1. `db-key` 0.0.5 → 0.1.0 (store) — new Key trait uses standard `From<&[u8]>` + `AsRef<[u8]>` instead of custom `from_u8`/`as_slice` methods. Updated `BytesKey` impl.
2. `headers` 0.3 → 0.4 (warp_utils) — moves to base64 0.22 and headers-core 0.3. No API changes needed (same `Origin::try_from_parts` call).

**Investigated but not upgraded** (blocked by ecosystem):
- `reqwest-eventsource` 0.5 → 0.6: requires `reqwest` 0.11 → 0.12 upgrade (different `http` crate versions cause `StatusCode` type mismatch)
- `rand_xorshift` 0.4 → 0.5: requires `rand` 0.8 → 0.9 upgrade (different `rand_core` versions cause `SeedableRng` trait mismatch)
- `hash-db` 0.15 → 0.16 + `keccak-hash` 0.10 → 0.12: blocked by `triehash` 0.8.4 pinning `hash-db` 0.15

**Verification**: 32/32 store + warp_utils tests, full workspace build clean, full lint clean.

### Run 580 — replace deprecated Parity trie libs with alloy-trie (2026-03-08)

**Spec status**: v1.7.0-alpha.2 still latest release. PR #4979 (PTC lookbehind) still open/unmerged. No new Gloas spec changes.

**Replaced 4 deprecated Parity crates** with alloy-trie (already a transitive dependency):
- Removed: `hash-db` 0.15.2, `hash256-std-hasher` 0.15.2, `keccak-hash` 0.10.0, `triehash` 0.8.4
- Replaced `triehash::ordered_trie_root::<KeccakHasher, _>()` with `alloy_trie::root::ordered_trie_root_with_encoder()`
- Replaced `keccak_hash::KECCAK_EMPTY_LIST_RLP` with local `const` (same bytes)
- Removed `KeccakHasher` struct and `hash_db::Hasher` impl (no longer needed)
- Simplified `keccak.rs` to just the `keccak256()` helper

Net: -86 lines, -4 deprecated dependencies, no new direct dependencies (alloy-trie was already in tree).

**Remaining blocked upgrades**: rand_xorshift 0.5 (needs rand_core 0.10, we have 0.9).

**Verification**: 10/10 block_hash + execution_layer tests pass, full workspace build clean, full lint clean.

### Run 581 — dependency upgrades: itertools 0.14, reqwest-eventsource 0.6, alloy-trie 0.9 (2026-03-08)

**Spec status**: v1.7.0-alpha.2 still latest release. No new Gloas spec changes merged. Recent consensus-specs PRs (#4977-#4988) are all infrastructure/tooling changes unrelated to Gloas.

**CI status**: all green on latest push.

**Dependency upgrades shipped**:
1. `itertools` 0.10 → 0.14 (workspace-wide) — eliminates one duplicate version, API-compatible
2. `reqwest-eventsource` 0.5 → 0.6 — adapted `InvalidStatusCode` handling for `http` 1.x `StatusCode` type (convert via `as_u16()`)
3. `alloy-trie` 0.8 → 0.9 — API-compatible, no code changes needed

**Remaining duplicate versions** (all transitive, not actionable):
- `itertools`: 0.10 (criterion), 0.12 (bindgen), 0.13 (ethereum_ssz/milhouse), 0.14 (our code + superstruct)
- `rand_xorshift` 0.4 → 0.5: still blocked by rand_core version mismatch (needs rand 0.10, we have 0.9)

**Verification**: 80/80 eth2 + execution_layer tests, 64/64 targeted itertools-using tests, full workspace clippy clean, full lint clean.

### Run 583 — remove leveldb backend (2026-03-08)

**Scope**: Remove the optional leveldb database backend entirely. vibehouse is independent and uses redb exclusively (switched in run 572). leveldb was never compiled by default, but its code and C dependency added maintenance burden.

**Changes**:
1. Deleted `beacon_node/store/src/database/leveldb_impl.rs` (299 lines)
2. Simplified `BeaconNodeBackend` from cfg-gated enum to direct `struct(Redb<E>)` wrapper
3. Removed `leveldb` dependency from store/Cargo.toml (C dependency eliminated)
4. Removed `beacon-node-leveldb` and `beacon-node-redb` features from lighthouse/Cargo.toml
5. Removed all `#[cfg(feature = "leveldb")]` and `#[cfg(feature = "redb")]` gates in errors.rs, config.rs, database.rs
6. Removed cfg-gated test `beacon_node_backend_override` from lighthouse tests
7. Updated Makefile: removed `beacon-node-redb` from CROSS_FEATURES and lint-full
8. Updated book/installation_source.md: removed leveldb feature documentation
9. Updated comments referencing LevelDB in 4 files

**Net**: -540 lines, -1 C dependency (`leveldb` crate + `leveldb-sys`).

**Verification**: 30/30 store tests, full workspace build clean, full workspace clippy clean, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 586 — remove unused deps from 3 more crates, sort execution_layer (2026-03-08)

**Scope**: Continue dependency cleanup using cargo-machete with manual verification.

**Changes**:
1. `beacon_node/genesis` — removed unused `tracing` (no tracing macros in source)
2. `boot_node` — removed unused `log` (uses `tracing` directly, not `log` crate)
3. `lcli` — removed unused `log` (same reason)
4. `beacon_node/execution_layer` — sorted Cargo.toml deps (`alloy-trie` was out of alphabetical order)

**Not removed** (false positives):
- `eth2` `rand` — needed by TestRandom derive macro
- `state_processing` `rand` — same (TestRandom derive)
- `merkle_proof` `alloy-primitives` — feature forwarding (`arbitrary = ["alloy-primitives/arbitrary"]`)
- `lcli` `bls` — feature forwarding (`portable = ["bls/supranational-portable"]`, `fake_crypto = ["bls/fake_crypto"]`)
- All `ethereum_ssz`/`ethereum_serde_utils` — derive macros

**Verification**: 2/2 genesis tests, full workspace build clean, full clippy clean, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 587 — fix redb 3.x compaction CI failure (2026-03-08)

**CI failure**: `store_tests::prune_historic_states` panicked with `RedbError(TransactionInProgress)` at store_tests.rs:4780. Introduced by redb 2.x → 3.1.0 upgrade (run 575).

**Root cause**: In redb 3.x, `Database::compact()` fails with `CompactionError::TransactionInProgress` if any read transactions are alive. In `prune_historic_states`, after deleting cold state data, `compact_freezer()` is called. If background tasks hold read transactions on the cold DB at that point, compaction fails. In redb 2.x this was not an error.

**Fix**: Modified `Redb::compact()` to silently skip compaction when `TransactionInProgress` is returned. Compaction is an optimization (space reclamation), not a correctness requirement — it can safely be skipped and retried later.

**Verification**: `prune_historic_states` test passes, 30/30 store tests pass, full clippy clean, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 588 — CI verification + codebase health check (2026-03-08)

**CI result**: All 6 jobs pass (check+clippy, ef-tests, unit-tests, beacon_chain, http_api, network+op_pool). The redb 3.x compaction fix (647292d28) resolves the `prune_historic_states` TransactionInProgress failure.

**Health checks performed**:
- `cargo clippy --workspace`: zero warnings
- `cargo build --workspace`: zero warnings
- `cargo sort --workspace --check`: all Cargo.toml deps sorted

### Run 593 — reqwest 0.11 → 0.12 upgrade (2026-03-08)
- Upgraded workspace reqwest from 0.11 to 0.12, eliminating duplicate reqwest versions for workspace crates
- reqwest 0.11 remains only as a transitive dep from ethers (in execution_engine_integration test crate)
- Simplified deposit_contract build script: removed reqwest/serde_json build-deps, now just verifies checksums of committed contract files
- Added local `serde_warp_status_code` module in http_api since warp 0.3 still uses http 0.2 (different StatusCode type from reqwest 0.12's http 1.x)
- Fixed broadcast_validation_tests to handle dual StatusCode types (warp's http 0.2 for function args, reqwest's http 1.x for response checking)
- Remaining duplicate deps are all transitive from external crates (ethers, warp, libp2p, criterion) — not fixable without replacing those crates

### Run 596 — strum 0.24 → 0.27, uuid 0.8 → 1.x (2026-03-08)

**Scope**: Upgrade two direct workspace dependencies to eliminate duplicate crate versions.

**Changes**:
1. `strum` 0.24 → 0.27: renamed deprecated `EnumVariantNames` derive to `VariantNames` in 3 files (database_manager, slasher, beacon_node_fallback). All other strum derives (`AsRefStr`, `IntoStaticStr`, `EnumString`, `Display`, `EnumIter`, `IntoEnumIterator`) unchanged.
2. `uuid` 0.8 → 1.x: zero code changes needed — `Uuid::new_v4()`, `parse_str()`, `from_u128()` all API-compatible.

**Result**: Lockfile 1039 → 1035 packages (-4). Eliminated strum 0.24 + strum_macros 0.24 + uuid 0.8 duplicates. Remaining duplicates are all transitive (warp http 0.2 stack, libp2p, criterion, etc.).

**Spec status**: stable, no new Gloas merges since run 595. PR #4979 (PTC Lookbehind) still open. PR #4950 (by_root serve range) merged Mar 6 — already assessed as no-change-needed.

**Verification**: 98/98 targeted tests (eth2_keystore, eth2_wallet, eth2_wallet_manager, slasher, database_manager, beacon_node_fallback), full workspace clippy clean, full lint-full clean (pre-push hook).

### Run 611: vibehouse identity rebranding

**Scope**: Rebrand user-visible identity strings from "Lighthouse" to "vibehouse".

**Changes**:
1. `lighthouse_version/src/lib.rs`: VERSION prefix "vibehouse/v0.1.0-", `client_name()` returns "vibehouse", `version()` returns "0.1.0", test regex updated
2. `lighthouse/src/main.rs`: CLI name "vibehouse", about text updated, Sigma Prime author removed, telemetry service names "vibehouse-bn"/"vibehouse-vc", tracer name "vibehouse", SHORT_VERSION strip prefix updated
3. `monitoring_api/src/types.rs`: CLIENT_NAME = "vibehouse"
4. `environment/src/tracing_common.rs`: logfile prefix "vibehouse"
5. `lighthouse_network/src/peer_manager/peerdb/client.rs`: added `Vibehouse` ClientKind variant with "vibehouse" agent string matching, Display impl
6. `beacon_node/src/cli.rs`: removed Sigma Prime author
7. `simulator/src/cli.rs`: removed Sigma Prime author
8. `graffiti_file/src/lib.rs`: test default graffiti "vibehouse"

**Not changed** (intentionally):
- API paths (`/lighthouse/...`) — breaking change for external tooling
- Binary name (`lighthouse`) — DONE in run 613 (see below)
- Crate names (`lighthouse_network`, `lighthouse_validator_store`) — internal, no user impact

**Verification**: lighthouse_version, monitoring_api, graffiti_file tests pass; default_graffiti beacon_node test passes; full workspace cargo check clean; clippy clean; pre-push lint-full clean.

### Run 613: binary rename lighthouse → vibehouse (2026-03-09)

**Scope**: Rename the compiled binary from `lighthouse` to `vibehouse` across all build infrastructure.

**Changes** (20 files):
1. `lighthouse/Cargo.toml`: `name = "lighthouse"` → `name = "vibehouse"`, version `8.0.1` → `0.1.0`, removed Sigma Prime author
2. `Makefile`: `--bin lighthouse` → `--bin vibehouse`, tarball/install paths updated, Docker image tags `vibehouse:reproducible-*`
3. `Dockerfile`: copy dir `lighthouse` → `vibehouse`, binary path `/usr/local/bin/vibehouse`, added `lighthouse` symlink for kurtosis compat
4. `Dockerfile.dev`: binary path updated, `lighthouse` symlink added
5. `Dockerfile.reproducible`: `--bin vibehouse`, binary path updated, entrypoint `/vibehouse`
6. `Dockerfile.cross`: binary path updated, `lighthouse` symlink added
7. `lcli/Dockerfile`: copy dir updated, comment fixed
8. `scripts/build-docker.sh`: binary name in cargo build output and `cp` command
9. `scripts/cli.sh`: `CMD=./target/release/vibehouse`
10. `.config/nextest.toml`: report name `vibehouse-run`
11. `.github/workflows/release.yml`: repo/image names, artifact names, runner conditions all → `vibehouse`/`dapplion`
12. `.github/workflows/docker.yml`: matrix binary `vibehouse`, runner conditions → `dapplion/vibehouse`
13. `lighthouse/tests/*.rs` (5 files): `CARGO_BIN_EXE_lighthouse` → `CARGO_BIN_EXE_vibehouse`
14. `README.md`: `./target/release/vibehouse --help`
15. `book/src/installation_homebrew.md`: binary name in path

**Kurtosis compatibility**: Docker images include `ln -s /usr/local/bin/vibehouse /usr/local/bin/lighthouse` so the ethereum-package's `cl_type: lighthouse` startup commands still work.

**Not changed** (intentionally):
- Kurtosis yaml `cl_type: lighthouse` — this is the ethereum-package's client type identifier, not our binary name
- `/lighthouse/...` API paths — would break external tooling
- Crate names — internal, no user impact
- `lighthouse/` directory name — workspace member path, not user-visible

**Verification**: `cargo build --release` clean, `vibehouse --version` shows `vibehouse v0.1.0`, 312/312 package tests pass, clippy clean, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 615: finish vc/lcli rebranding (2026-03-09)

**Scope**: Rebrand remaining user-visible "Lighthouse" references missed in runs 611-614.

**Changes** (3 files):
1. `validator_client/src/cli.rs`: 4 CLI help text strings — doppelganger protection, builder proposals, prefer builder proposals, web3signer slashing protection
2. `validator_client/http_api/src/lib.rs`: 6 error messages "Lighthouse shutting down" → "vibehouse shutting down"
3. `lcli/src/main.rs`: Command name "Lighthouse CLI Tool" → "vibehouse CLI Tool"

**Remaining "lighthouse" references** (intentionally kept):
- API paths (`.push("lighthouse")`) — breaking change for external tooling
- Test infrastructure file paths (`tls_dir().join("lighthouse")`) — test artifacts
- Test rig temp dir prefixes — internal

**Verification**: cargo check clean, validator_client tests pass, clippy clean, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 616: lighthouse_validator_store crate rename (2026-03-09)

Renamed `lighthouse_validator_store` crate and `LighthouseValidatorStore` struct to `vibehouse_validator_store` / `VibehouseValidatorStore`.

### Run 617: rename 3 remaining lighthouse_* crates (2026-03-09)

**Scope**: Rename the last 3 crates with "lighthouse" in their names.

**Changes** (3 crate renames, 145+ files):
1. `common/lighthouse_version` → `common/vibehouse_version` — package name, directory, all imports and Cargo.toml deps (33 files)
2. `beacon_node/lighthouse_tracing` → `beacon_node/vibehouse_tracing` — package name, directory, all imports and Cargo.toml deps (19 files)
3. `beacon_node/lighthouse_network` → `beacon_node/vibehouse_network` — package name, directory, all imports and Cargo.toml deps (113 files)

Also updated comments/variable names referencing "lighthouse" in graffiti_calculator.rs and network/Cargo.toml.

**Remaining "lighthouse" references**:
- API paths (`.push("lighthouse")`) — breaking change for external tooling
- `lighthouse/` workspace directory (binary crate) — already renamed to `vibehouse` binary
- `LighthouseSubcommands` enum — internal CLI dispatch
- `eth2` crate feature flag `lighthouse` and modules `lighthouse.rs`, `lighthouse_vc/` — API client paths
- Test infrastructure file paths — test artifacts

**Verification**: cargo check clean, cargo fmt clean, clippy clean (pre-push lint-full passes).

### Run 1173: skip JustifiedBalances clone in find_head when unchanged (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Performance optimization in fork choice hot path.

**Problem**: `ProtoArrayForkChoice::find_head()` cloned the `JustifiedBalances` struct into `self.balances` every slot. On mainnet with ~1M validators, `effective_balances: Vec<u64>` is ~8MB. This clone happened every 12 seconds even though the balances only change when the justified checkpoint changes (~every 32 slots on mainnet, every 8 slots on minimal).

**Fix**: Added `maybe_update_balances()` method that compares three cheap summary fields (`effective_balances.len()`, `total_effective_balance`, `num_active_validators`) before cloning. If all match, the clone is skipped. These fields change whenever the justified checkpoint changes (new epoch = different rewards/penalties = different total), so the check is effectively exact.

**Edge case handling**: On fresh start, `self.balances` is `JustifiedBalances::default()` (empty Vec, zero total), so the length mismatch triggers the clone on the first call. On restart from persisted state, `self.balances` is populated from SSZ.

**Impact**: Eliminates ~8MB allocation per slot on mainnet (~31 out of 32 slots per epoch). Saves ~240MB/min of allocation churn.

**Verification**: 188/188 proto_array tests, 119/119 fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, clippy clean (pre-push lint-full passes).

### Run 1174: derive Copy for AttestationShufflingId (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Type-level optimization to eliminate unnecessary clone overhead.

**Problem**: `AttestationShufflingId` is a 40-byte struct (8-byte `Epoch` + 32-byte `Hash256`) with both fields already `Copy`, but the type only derived `Clone`. Every use of `.clone()` went through the Clone trait's heap-awareness machinery instead of a simple bitwise copy.

**Fix**: Added `Copy` to the derive list on `AttestationShufflingId`, then removed all `.clone()` calls on this type across the codebase (9 files, ~15 call sites in proto_array, beacon_chain, shuffling_cache, early_attester_cache, state_advance_timer).

**Impact**: Minor — eliminates Clone trait overhead for a small Copy-eligible type. Mainly a correctness-of-trait-bounds improvement.

**Verification**: 307/307 proto_array + fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, clippy clean workspace-wide, pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 1175: derive Copy for PayloadAttestationData + light client cache clone avoidance (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Two performance optimizations targeting unnecessary clones.

**Change 1 — PayloadAttestationData Copy derivation**:
- `PayloadAttestationData` is a 42-byte struct (Hash256 + Slot + 2 bools) with all Copy fields, but only derived Clone.
- Added `Copy` to the derive list, then removed all `.clone()` calls on this type across the codebase (10 files, ~20 call sites in beacon_chain, state_processing, network, http_api, validator_client, types tests).
- Eliminates Clone trait overhead for a frequently-used type (HashMap key in payload attestation aggregation, struct field copies in gossip verification).

**Change 2 — Light client server cache clone avoidance**:
- `LightClientServerCache::recompute_and_cache_updates()` cloned entire `LightClientOptimisticUpdate` and `LightClientFinalityUpdate` structs just to call `is_latest()` (which only compares two Slot values).
- Replaced `.read().clone()` pattern with `.read().as_ref().is_none_or(|u| u.is_latest(...))` — borrows through the read guard instead of cloning.
- Also optimized `get_light_client_update()` to check period via read guard before cloning, only cloning when the cached value matches the requested period.

**Verification**: 1597/1597 types+state_processing+fork_choice+proto_array tests, 56/56 validator_store+validator_services tests, 2/2 light client tests, full workspace clippy clean (lib + all targets), pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 1176: derive Copy for 5 small fixed-size types (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Type-level optimization — derive Copy for small, all-Copy-field types to eliminate unnecessary Clone trait overhead.

**Types made Copy**:
1. **AttestationData** (128 bytes: Slot + u64 + Hash256 + 2×Checkpoint) — heavily used in attestation processing, 15+ clone sites removed
2. **Eth1Data** (72 bytes: Hash256 + u64 + Hash256) — used in every state upgrade and block body, 10 clone sites removed
3. **VoluntaryExit** (16 bytes: Epoch + u64) — compact exit type, 1 clone site removed
4. **SigningData** (64 bytes: 2×Hash256) — used in all signing operations
5. **ForkData** (36 bytes: [u8;4] + Hash256) — fork specification type

**Clone removals**: 32 files changed, ~25 `.clone()` calls removed across production and test code. Replaced with either direct copy (field access), dereference (`*getter()`), or removal of redundant clone call.

**Verification**: 715/715 types tests, 575/575 state_processing tests, 307/307 fork_choice+proto_array tests, 69/69 EF SSZ static tests, 72/72 slasher+slashing_protection tests, 30/30 store tests. Full workspace clippy clean (lib + all targets + benches), pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 1177: reuse filtered_nodes and children_index allocations in find_head_gloas (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Allocation reuse in the per-slot Gloas fork choice hot path.

**Problem**: `find_head_gloas` is called every slot and allocated two fresh data structures each time:
1. `filtered_nodes: Vec<bool>` (~4-5KB, one entry per proto_array node) via `compute_filtered_nodes`
2. `children_index: HashMap<usize, Vec<usize>>` (~16-32KB) via `build_children_index`

These allocations were discarded after each call, creating unnecessary allocation churn on the per-slot hot path.

**Fix**: Added `gloas_filtered_buf: Vec<bool>` and `gloas_children_buf: HashMap<usize, Vec<usize>>` fields to `ProtoArrayForkChoice`. The `compute_filtered_nodes_into` method now reuses the Vec (clear + resize), and `build_children_index_into` clears the HashMap values but keeps the bucket storage. Both methods fill the buffers in-place. Added `from_parts` constructor for SSZ deserialization. Test-facing `compute_filtered_nodes` wrapper returns a clone of the buffer.

**Impact**: Eliminates ~20-37KB of heap allocation per slot on mainnet. The allocations now happen once and are reused across all subsequent `find_head_gloas` calls. The `ancestor_cache` HashMap was already reused (from a prior optimization); this extends the same pattern to the remaining two per-call allocations.

**Verification**: 188/188 proto_array tests, 119/119 fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, clippy clean.

### Run 1178: derive Copy for SignatureBytes (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Type-level optimization — make `GenericSignatureBytes` (the `SignatureBytes` type alias) implement `Copy`.

**Problem**: `GenericSignatureBytes<Pub, Sig>` is a fixed `[u8; 96]` + two `PhantomData` fields — entirely bitwise-copyable — but only derived `Clone`. Every `.signature.clone()` on types like `PendingDeposit`, `DepositRequest`, `DepositData` went through the Clone trait instead of a simple memcpy. `GenericPublicKeyBytes` (48 bytes) already had a manual `Copy` impl as precedent.

**Fix**: Added manual `Copy` impl for `GenericSignatureBytes<Pub, Sig>` (matching the `GenericPublicKeyBytes` pattern — manual `Copy` impl + manual `Clone` via `*self`, no bounds on `Pub`/`Sig` since only `PhantomData` uses them). Replaced `#[derive(Clone)]` with manual `Clone` impl.

**Clone removals**: 8 `.clone()` calls removed across 5 files:
- `process_operations.rs`: 5 `request.signature.clone()` / `pending_deposit.signature.clone()` → direct copy
- `upgrade/gloas.rs`: 2 `deposit.signature.clone()` / `signature.clone()` → direct copy / `*signature`
- `test_utils.rs`: 1 `invalid_signature.clone()` on `Option<SignatureBytes>` → direct copy
- `create_validators.rs`: 1 `deposit.signature.clone()` → direct copy

**Verification**: 575/575 state_processing tests, 715/715 types tests, 307/307 fork_choice+proto_array tests, 69/69 EF SSZ static tests, 35/35 EF operations+epoch+sanity tests, full workspace lint-full clean.

### Run 1179: derive Copy for 10 small fixed-size types + historical_data_columns clone fix (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Type-level optimization — derive Copy for 10 small, all-Copy-field types to eliminate unnecessary Clone trait overhead. Plus one unnecessary HashSet clone fix.

**Types made Copy**:
1. **Withdrawal** (32 bytes: 3×u64 + Address) — used in every block's withdrawal processing
2. **PendingDeposit** (177 bytes: PublicKeyBytes + Hash256 + u64 + SignatureBytes + Slot) — used in epoch deposit processing
3. **DepositData** (184 bytes: PublicKeyBytes + Hash256 + u64 + SignatureBytes) — used in deposit verification
4. **DepositRequest** (192 bytes: PublicKeyBytes + Hash256 + u64 + SignatureBytes + u64) — used in execution request processing
5. **DepositMessage** (88 bytes: PublicKeyBytes + Hash256 + u64) — deposit signature verification
6. **WithdrawalRequest** (68 bytes: Address + PublicKeyBytes + u64) — execution request processing
7. **ConsolidationRequest** (116 bytes: Address + 2×PublicKeyBytes) — consolidation request processing
8. **PendingConsolidation** (16 bytes: 2×u64) — epoch consolidation processing
9. **PendingPartialWithdrawal** (24 bytes: 2×u64 + Epoch) — withdrawal processing
10. **SyncAggregatorSelectionData** (16 bytes: Slot + u64) — sync committee selection

**Clone removals**: 17 files changed. ~12 `.clone()` calls removed across production and test code (state_processing, execution_layer, types).

**Additional fix**: `historical_data_columns.rs` — replaced `unique_column_indices.clone()` (HashSet clone per outer loop iteration) with `&unique_column_indices` iteration by reference. ColumnIndex is u64 (Copy), so iterating by reference works fine.

**Verification**: 715/715 types tests, 575/575 state_processing tests, 307/307 fork_choice+proto_array tests, 69/69 EF SSZ static tests, 35/35 EF operations+epoch+sanity tests, full workspace clippy clean (lib + all targets), pre-push lint-full passes.

### Run 1182: get_proposer_head Vec allocation elimination (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Allocation optimization in fork choice hot path.

**Problem**: `get_proposer_head_info` collected 2 `ProtoNode` elements into a `Vec`, then popped them out in reverse order. This allocated a Vec (heap + 2 large ProtoNode clones) when simple iterator extraction sufficed.

**Fix**: Replaced `.take(2).cloned().collect::<Vec<_>>()` + `.pop()` + `.pop()` with `.cloned()` iterator + `.next()` + `.next()`. The iterator directly yields head then parent (ancestor order), eliminating the Vec allocation entirely. The `take(2)` was also unnecessary since we only call `.next()` twice.

**Impact**: Eliminates one Vec heap allocation per `get_proposer_head_info` call (called on every slot for proposer head computation). ProtoNode is a large struct (~300+ bytes with all Gloas fields), so avoiding even 2 clones into a temporary Vec is worthwhile.

**Also reviewed**: Checked 3 post-alpha.3 consensus-specs PRs (#5001, #4940, #5002) — all already handled by vibehouse.

**Verification**: 188/188 proto_array tests, 119/119 fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, clippy clean.

### Run 1183: reuse active_votes allocation in find_head_gloas (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Allocation optimization in the per-slot Gloas fork choice hot path.

**Problem**: `find_head_gloas` allocated a fresh `Vec<(&VoteTracker, u64)>` every slot, collecting all active validators' vote references and balances. On mainnet with ~1M validators, each entry is 16 bytes (reference + u64), totaling ~12MB of allocation per slot. This Vec was discarded after each call.

**Fix**: Added `gloas_active_votes_buf: Vec<(u32, u64)>` field to `ProtoArrayForkChoice`. Instead of storing vote references (which create lifetime issues preventing field storage), the buffer stores `(vote_index, balance)` pairs. Inner loops access vote data via `self.votes.0[idx as usize]`. The buffer is cleared and refilled each call but retains its heap allocation across slots.

**Changes**:
- Added `gloas_active_votes_buf` field to `ProtoArrayForkChoice`, initialized empty in `from_parts` and `new`
- Changed `find_head_gloas` to fill `self.gloas_active_votes_buf` instead of allocating a local Vec
- Changed `get_gloas_weight` and `should_apply_proposer_boost_gloas` signature: `active_votes: &[(u32, u64)]` instead of `&[(&VoteTracker, u64)]`
- Inner loops now access votes via index: `let vote = &self.votes.0[vote_idx as usize]`
- Added `compute_active_votes()` test helper for test functions that need one-off active vote slices
- Note: `ancestor_cache` HashMap could NOT be made a field due to `&mut` borrow conflict with `&self` method calls

**Impact**: Eliminates ~12MB of allocation per slot on mainnet (after first slot). The extra array index lookup per vote in the inner loop is negligible compared to the saved allocation.

**Verification**: 188/188 proto_array tests, 119/119 fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1185: skip delta Vec allocation in Gloas fork choice path (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate unnecessary allocation in the per-slot fork choice hot path.

**Problem**: `find_head` called `compute_deltas` unconditionally, which allocates `vec![0_i64; indices.len()]` (one i64 per proto_array node) and does HashMap lookups + arithmetic for every changed vote. In Gloas mode, `find_head_gloas` was called immediately after, and the delta Vec was dropped without ever being used — Gloas computes weights directly from votes via `get_gloas_weight`, not from accumulated deltas.

The vote-tracker side effects (advancing `current_root` to `next_root`, zeroing equivocated votes) are needed before `find_head_gloas` runs, but the actual delta values are not.

**Fix**: Split the vote-tracker side effects into a new `apply_vote_updates` function that performs the same mutations as `compute_deltas` but without allocating the delta Vec or doing any delta arithmetic/HashMap lookups. In Gloas mode, `apply_vote_updates` is called instead of `compute_deltas`. In pre-Gloas mode, `compute_deltas` is still called (moved after the `is_gloas` check).

**Impact**: Eliminates one Vec allocation per slot (`indices.len() * 8` bytes, typically 8-80KB on mainnet depending on tree depth) plus O(changed_votes) HashMap lookups for delta computation that were immediately discarded.

**Also verified**: Spec stable — no new consensus-specs commits since run 1184. PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. PR #4940 (Gloas fork choice tests) merged into v1.7.0-alpha.3 — all 46 Gloas fork choice test cases pass (ex_ante: 3, get_head: 9, on_block: 23, on_execution_payload: 1, reorg: 8, withholding: 2).

**Verification**: 307/307 proto_array+fork_choice tests, 9/9 EF fork choice spec tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full + all targets), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1189: replace Hash256::from_slice with Hash256::from for fixed-size arrays (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate unnecessary slice indirection in Hash256 construction from fixed-size `[u8; 32]` arrays.

**Problem**: Multiple call sites used `Hash256::from_slice(&array)` where `array` is already a `[u8; 32]`. `from_slice` takes `&[u8]` (dynamic slice) and performs a runtime length check, while `From<[u8; 32]>` is a direct, zero-cost conversion. One call site (`compute_kzg_proof`) additionally called `.to_vec()` to create a heap-allocated Vec just to pass to `from_slice`.

**Changes** (7 files):
- `kzg_utils.rs:150`: `Hash256::from_slice(&z.to_vec())` → `Hash256::from(*z)` — eliminates heap allocation (Bytes32 derefs to [u8; 32])
- `kzg_commitment.rs:23`: `Hash256::from_slice(versioned_hash.as_slice())` → `Hash256::from(versioned_hash)` — hash_fixed returns [u8; 32]
- `beacon_block_header.rs:46`: `Hash256::from_slice(&self.tree_hash_root()[..])` → `self.tree_hash_root()` — tree_hash::Hash256 IS types::Hash256 (both alloy B256), round-trip was a no-op
- `slot_epoch_macros.rs:291`: `Hash256::from_slice(&int_to_bytes32(...))` → `Hash256::from(int_to_bytes32(...))` — int_to_bytes32 returns [u8; 32]
- `deposit_tree_snapshot.rs:72`: `Hash256::from_slice(&deposit_root)` → `Hash256::from(deposit_root)` — hash32_concat returns [u8; 32]
- `genesis/interop.rs:16,24`: `Hash256::from_slice(&credentials)` → `Hash256::from(credentials)` — credentials are [u8; 32] arrays
- `genesis/common.rs:29`: `Hash256::from_slice(&int_to_bytes32(...))` → `Hash256::from(int_to_bytes32(...))` — int_to_bytes32 returns [u8; 32]

**Also checked**: Spec stable — no new consensus-specs commits since run 1188. PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN, NOT MERGED (1 APPROVED). No new spec test releases (still v1.6.0-beta.0). PRs #5001 and #5002 already implemented/compatible.

**Verification**: 715/715 types tests, 2/2 kzg tests, 2/2 genesis tests, 69/69 EF SSZ static tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1191: accept cell_proofs by reference in blobs_to_data_column_sidecars

**Problem**: `blobs_to_data_column_sidecars` took `cell_proofs: Vec<KzgProof>` by value, but only used `.len()` and `.chunks_exact()` on it — both of which work on `&[T]`. This forced every caller to allocate a new Vec via `.to_vec()` on their `KzgProofs<E>` (VariableList), copying all proof data unnecessarily.

**Fix**: Changed the parameter type from `Vec<KzgProof>` to `&[KzgProof]`. Updated all 9 call sites (1 production in block_verification.rs, 1 production in fetch_blobs/mod.rs, 6 tests in kzg_utils.rs, 1 bench). Since `VariableList<T, N>` implements `Deref<Target = [T]>`, callers now simply pass `&proofs` instead of `proofs.to_vec()`.

**Verification**: 2/2 KZG tests pass, bench + test compilation clean, full clippy clean.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1190. Spec at v1.7.0-alpha.3. PR #4992 (cached PTCs) still OPEN.

### Run 1197: avoid Hash256 wrapper in compute_shuffled_index + deposit tree direct conversion (2026-03-14)

**Problem 1**: `compute_shuffled_index.rs` used `Hash256::from_slice(digest.as_ref())` in `hash_with_round` and `hash_with_round_and_position`, constructing a full Hash256 wrapper only to read 1 or 8 bytes from it. The `from_slice` call also performed a runtime length check on what was already a `[u8; 32]` return from `finalize()`.

**Fix 1**: Changed both hash helper functions to return `[u8; 32]` directly instead of Hash256, removing the `use crate::Hash256` import entirely. Simplified `bytes_to_int64` to take `&[u8; 32]` and use `try_into` for the slice-to-array conversion.

**Problem 2**: `deposit_data_tree.rs` used `Hash256::from_slice(&hash_fixed(...))` and `Hash256::from_slice(&self.length_bytes())` where the arguments were already `[u8; 32]` arrays.

**Fix 2**: Changed both to `Hash256::from(...)` for direct zero-cost conversion.

**Impact**: `compute_shuffled_index` is called for single-index shuffling (e.g. computing a specific validator's committee assignment). While `shuffle_list` is the primary hot path for full committee computation, `compute_shuffled_index` is used when only one index is needed. Removing the Hash256 intermediary eliminates unnecessary type wrapping per hash call (2 hashes per round × 90 rounds = 180 eliminated Hash256 constructions per index lookup).

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1196 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.6.0-beta.0). cargo audit unchanged (1 rsa, no fix).

**Verification**: 5/5 swap_or_not_shuffle tests, 1/1 EF shuffling tests, 3/3 EF deposit + genesis tests, full clippy clean (all targets).

### Run 1201: closure reference + pending_consolidations clone avoidance (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Two optimizations targeting per-block and per-epoch hot paths.

**Change 1 — Pass get_pubkey closure by reference in block signature verifier**:
- `BlockSignatureVerifier` cloned `self.get_pubkey` (a closure) at every signature set call site — 6 times per block (proposal, randao, proposer slashings, attester slashings, attestations, exits), plus once per proposer slashing and attester slashing in the block.
- Since `&F` implements `Fn` when `F: Fn`, the signature set functions can accept `&self.get_pubkey` directly instead of `self.get_pubkey.clone()`.
- Removed the `Clone` bound from `F` on `BlockSignatureVerifier` since it's no longer needed.
- Replaced all 6 `self.get_pubkey.clone()` call sites with `&self.get_pubkey`.

**Change 2 — Avoid cloning pending_consolidations list in epoch processing**:
- `process_pending_consolidations` cloned the entire `pending_consolidations` List to iterate while mutating state.
- Split into two passes: (1) read-only pass collects `(source_index, target_index, consolidated_balance)` tuples into a small Vec, (2) mutation pass applies balance changes.
- The Vec is bounded by the per-epoch consolidation churn limit (typically single-digit entries), so the allocation is minimal compared to cloning the entire list.

**Verification**: 575/575 state_processing tests, 19/19 EF epoch_processing + consolidation tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1202: avoid intermediate Vec allocation in PTC committee computation (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate unnecessary Vec allocation in `get_ptc_committee`, the per-slot Gloas PTC selection function.

**Problem**: `get_ptc_committee` concatenated all beacon committee validator indices into an intermediate `Vec<u64>` before doing weighted selection. On mainnet with 64 committees per slot and ~64 validators per committee, this allocated a ~32KB Vec (~4000 entries × 8 bytes) on every call. The Vec was only used for random-access lookups (`indices[i % total]`) during the ~16-20 iteration selection loop.

**Fix**: Replaced the intermediate `indices` Vec with direct committee-walk lookups. For each candidate, the function now walks the committees array to find the validator at the flat index. The committee walk is O(committees_per_slot) per candidate (~64 comparisons), but the total work (~20 × 64 = 1280 comparisons) is much cheaper than the eliminated allocation + 4000 push operations + cache pressure from the 32KB Vec.

**Changes**:
- Replaced `.sum()` with `.fold(0, |acc, c| acc.saturating_add(...))` (disallowed method)
- Replaced `indices` Vec construction with inline committee walk using `.get()` (no panicking index)
- Used `saturating_sub` for the remaining-index arithmetic (no arithmetic side effects)

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1201 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.6.0-beta.0). cargo audit unchanged (1 rsa, no fix).

**Verification**: 374/374 Gloas+PTC+payload_attestation tests, 15/15 EF operations spec tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full + all targets), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1203: attester_slashing_signature_sets closure reference (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Remove unnecessary `Clone` bound and closure clone in `attester_slashing_signature_sets`.

**Problem**: `attester_slashing_signature_sets` required `F: Fn(...) + Clone` and cloned the `get_pubkey` closure to pass it to `indexed_attestation_signature_set` twice. Since `&F` implements `Fn` when `F: Fn`, the first call can receive `&get_pubkey` instead of a clone, and the `Clone` bound is no longer needed.

**Fix**: Changed `get_pubkey.clone()` to `&get_pubkey` for the first call, removed the `+ Clone` bound from `F`. The caller in `block_signature_verifier.rs` already passes `&self.get_pubkey`, so no caller changes needed.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1202 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.6.0-beta.0).

**Verification**: 52/52 signature tests, 5/5 attester_slashing tests, clippy clean, fmt clean.

### Run 1205: eliminate heap allocations in merkle_root_from_branch (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Remove all Vec heap allocations from `merkle_root_from_branch`, the core merkle proof verification function.

**Problem**: `merkle_root_from_branch` used `Vec<u8>` for the running hash, allocating on every loop iteration:
- Line 385: `leaf.as_slice().to_vec()` — heap-allocated a 32-byte Vec from a fixed-size H256
- Line 390: `hash32_concat(...)[..].to_vec()` — heap-allocated a Vec from the `[u8; 32]` return of `hash32_concat`
- Line 392-394: `extend_from_slice` + `hash(&input)` — grew the Vec to 64 bytes, then `hash()` returned a new `Vec<u8>`
- Line 398: `H256::from_slice(&merkle_root)` — runtime length check on what was always 32 bytes

Every iteration allocated at least one Vec. For a depth-32 merkle tree (standard), that's 32+ heap allocations per proof verification.

**Fix**: Replaced the `Vec<u8>` with a `[u8; 32]` stack array throughout:
- `leaf.into()` for the initial conversion (zero-cost, H256 is B256 which is `[u8; 32]`)
- `hash32_concat(a, b)` directly returns `[u8; 32]` — no `.to_vec()` needed
- The `else` branch previously used `hash()` (returns `Vec<u8>`) with manual concatenation; replaced with `hash32_concat(&merkle_root, leaf.as_slice())` which is semantically identical (`hash(h1 || h2)`)
- `H256::from(merkle_root)` for the final conversion (zero-cost `From<[u8; 32]>`)
- Removed unused `hash` import from `ethereum_hashing`

**Impact**: `merkle_root_from_branch` is called by `verify_merkle_proof` which is used in deposit verification (`verify_deposit`), blob sidecar KZG inclusion proofs, and data column sidecar proofs. Eliminates ~depth heap allocations per call (typically 32).

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1204 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.6.0-beta.0).

**Verification**: 7/7 merkle_proof tests (including quickcheck), 2/2 EF genesis tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1206: eliminate heap allocations in batch signature verification (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Remove unnecessary heap allocations from `verify_signature_sets` in `crypto/bls/src/impls/blst.rs`, the core batch BLS signature verification function used for every block and attestation.

**Problem**: Three unnecessary allocations:
1. Line 39: `signature_sets.collect::<Vec<_>>()` — collected an `ExactSizeIterator` into a Vec just to get `.len()` and iterate. The length is available from the iterator directly via `.len()`.
2. Lines 92-96: `set.signing_keys.iter().map(|pk| pk.point()).collect::<Vec<_>>()` — allocated a new Vec of public key references on every iteration of the main loop (once per signature set). For a typical block with ~128 attestations, that's ~128 heap allocations.
3. Line 106: `sigs.iter().zip(pks.iter()).unzip()` — created two new Vecs via zip+unzip when simple `.iter().collect()` on each Vec is cleaner (same allocation count but avoids the zip overhead).

**Fix**:
1. Use `signature_sets.len()` before consuming the iterator, then iterate directly — eliminates one Vec allocation
2. Declare `signing_keys_buf: Vec<&blst_core::PublicKey>` outside the loop, `.clear()` + `.extend()` each iteration — the buffer's heap allocation is retained across iterations, eliminating N-1 allocations where N is the number of signature sets
3. Replace `unzip()` with two direct `.iter().collect()` calls

**Impact**: `verify_signature_sets` is called on every block import (batch verifying all signatures: block signature, RANDAO, proposer slashings, attester slashings, attestations, voluntary exits, sync committee). A typical mainnet block has 5-10 signature sets with 1-128 signing keys each. This eliminates 1 + (N-1) heap allocations per call where N is the number of signature sets.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1205 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.7.0-alpha.3).

**Verification**: 37/37 BLS tests, 8/8 EF BLS spec tests (including bls_batch_verify), 52/52 signature state_processing tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1208: remove unnecessary AggregateSignature clone in verify functions (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Remove unnecessary `.clone()` calls on `blst_core::AggregateSignature` in `fast_aggregate_verify` and `aggregate_verify`.

**Problem**: `BlstAggregateSignature::fast_aggregate_verify` (line 257) and `aggregate_verify` (line 271) both did `self.0.clone().to_signature()`, cloning the entire `AggregateSignature` before converting to `Signature`. However, `AggregateSignature::to_signature()` takes `&self` — proven by `serialize()` (line 241) which calls `self.0.to_signature()` without clone successfully.

**Fix**: Changed both call sites from `self.0.clone().to_signature()` to `self.0.to_signature()`, eliminating two unnecessary cryptographic type clones per signature verification.

**Impact**: `fast_aggregate_verify` is called for every attestation and sync committee signature verification. `aggregate_verify` is used in batch verification paths. Each clone copies the internal BLS point representation (~96 bytes). On mainnet with ~128 attestations per block, this eliminates ~128 unnecessary aggregate signature copies per block import.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1207 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.7.0-alpha.3).

**Verification**: 37/37 BLS tests, 8/8 EF BLS spec tests (including bls_batch_verify), 52/52 signature state_processing tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full + make lint), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1209: avoid allocations in sync committee and attestation verification (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Two optimizations targeting gossip verification hot paths.

**Change 1 — Return slice from get_subcommittee_pubkeys instead of Vec**:
- `SyncCommittee::get_subcommittee_pubkeys` previously returned `Vec<PublicKeyBytes>` by copying the subcommittee slice via `.to_vec()`. On mainnet, each subcommittee has 128 entries × 48 bytes = ~6KB copied per call.
- Changed return type to `&[PublicKeyBytes]`, returning a direct slice reference into the `FixedVector` backing store. Zero-copy.
- Updated the caller in `sync_committee_verification.rs` to bind the `Arc<SyncCommittee>` before slicing (required for borrow lifetimes), and changed `.into_iter()` to `.iter()` with explicit copy (`*pubkey`) for the filtered participant pubkeys.
- The caller in `test_utils.rs` already used `.iter()` on the result, so no changes needed there.

**Change 2 — Avoid cloning selection proof signatures for aggregator checks**:
- Both `SelectionProof` (attestation aggregation) and `SyncSelectionProof` (sync committee aggregation) required cloning the `Signature` (96 bytes) just to check aggregator status. The comments explicitly noted this as "known to be a relatively slow operation" with "Future optimizations should remove this clone."
- Added `is_aggregator_sig(&Signature, ...)` static methods to both types that take a reference instead of requiring ownership.
- Updated callers: `attestation_verification.rs` now extracts `&signed_aggregate.message.selection_proof` (reference) instead of `.clone()`, and calls `SelectionProof::is_aggregator_sig(...)`. `sync_committee_verification.rs` similarly calls `SyncSelectionProof::is_aggregator_sig::<T::EthSpec>(&signed_aggregate.message.selection_proof)`.
- Eliminates one 96-byte signature clone per aggregate attestation gossip verification and per sync committee contribution gossip verification.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1208 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). PR #4992 (cached PTCs in state) still OPEN. No new spec test releases (latest v1.7.0-alpha.3).

**Verification**: 5/5 attestation + sync committee verification tests, 6/6 types sync committee tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1210: use serialize() instead of as_ssz_bytes() in aggregator checks (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate Vec heap allocations in `SelectionProof` and `SyncSelectionProof` aggregator checks.

**Problem**: Both `is_aggregator_sig()` and `is_aggregator_from_modulo()` called `sig.as_ssz_bytes()` which invokes the default `Encode::as_ssz_bytes()` method — this creates a `Vec<u8>` with capacity 96, copies the signature bytes into it, then passes `&Vec<u8>` to `hash_fixed()`. Since `Signature::serialize()` returns `[u8; 96]` (a stack-allocated array) with identical content, calling `hash_fixed(&sig.serialize())` is semantically identical but avoids the heap allocation entirely.

**Fix**: Replaced all `as_ssz_bytes()` calls with `serialize()` in both `SelectionProof` (2 call sites) and `SyncSelectionProof` (2 call sites). Removed the now-unused `use ssz::Encode` imports from both files.

**Impact**: Eliminates one 96-byte Vec allocation per aggregator check. These checks run on every aggregate attestation and sync committee contribution received via gossip. On mainnet, this eliminates hundreds of unnecessary heap allocations per slot.

**Verification**: 1/1 sync_selection_proof test, 4/4 attestation + sync committee verification tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1211: replace HashSet allocation in block producer observation checks (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate unnecessary HashSet heap allocation in `observed_block_producers.rs` and `observed_slashable.rs`.

**Problem**: Both files used `block_roots.difference(&HashSet::from([block_root])).count() == 0` to check whether the set contains any block roots OTHER than the given one. This allocates a `HashSet` (with internal `HashMap` — bucket allocation + hashing) on every call, just to compare a single element.

**Fix**: Replaced with `block_roots.iter().any(|r| r != &block_root)`, which does a simple iteration with no allocations. The `observed_block_producers` check additionally uses `block_roots.contains(&block_root)` for the duplicate check, which was already present.

**Impact**: `observe_proposal_slashable` and `observe_proposer` are called for every gossip block received. On mainnet with ~1 block/slot across many peers propagating it, this eliminates one HashSet allocation per gossip block observation. The HashSet allocation included HashMap bucket allocation, hashing the block_root, and constructing the set structure — all for a single-element set.

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1210 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). No new spec test releases (latest v1.6.0-beta.0).

**Verification**: 4/4 observed_block_producers + observed_slashable tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1212: use serialize() instead of as_ssz_bytes()/ssz_encode() for signature hashing (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate Vec heap allocations from signature hashing in BeaconState and IndexedAttestation.

**Problem**: Three call sites used `as_ssz_bytes()` or `ssz_encode()` on `Signature`/`AggregateSignature` types, allocating a 96-byte `Vec<u8>` when `serialize()` returns a stack-allocated `[u8; 96]`:
1. `beacon_state.rs:1248` — `is_aggregator()` called `slot_signature.as_ssz_bytes()` for aggregator check hash
2. `beacon_state.rs:1589` — `update_randao_mix()` called `ssz_encode(signature)` for RANDAO mix update
3. `indexed_attestation.rs:203` — `Hash` impl called `self.signature().as_ssz_bytes()` for HashMap/HashSet hashing

**Fix**: Replaced all three with `.serialize()` which returns `[u8; 96]` on the stack. Removed now-unused `use ssz::Encode` from `indexed_attestation.rs` and `use ssz::{Encode, ssz_encode}` from `beacon_state.rs`.

**Impact**: `update_randao_mix` is called once per block. `is_aggregator` is called during aggregation checks. The `Hash` impl for `IndexedAttestation` is used in the operation pool's `HashSet`/`HashMap` operations. Each call previously allocated a 96-byte Vec on the heap; now uses the stack.

**Verification**: 715/715 types tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1213: remove unnecessary heap allocations in BLS Display/Debug and pubkey hashing (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Eliminate unnecessary `.to_vec()` and `.as_ssz_bytes()` calls in BLS crypto formatting and pubkey hashing functions.

**Problem**: Four categories of unnecessary allocations:
1. `impl_display!` macro (macros.rs:85): `hex_encode(self.serialize().to_vec())` — `.to_vec()` converts the stack-allocated `[u8; N]` array from `serialize()` to a heap-allocated `Vec<u8>`, but `hex_encode` takes `T: AsRef<[u8]>` which `[u8; N]` already implements.
2. `impl_debug!` macro (macros.rs:160): Same pattern with `hex_encode(&self.serialize().to_vec())`.
3. `get_withdrawal_credentials` (get_withdrawal_credentials.rs:9): `pubkey.as_ssz_bytes()` allocates a 48-byte `Vec<u8>` when `pubkey.serialize()` returns `[u8; 48]` on the stack.
4. `bls_withdrawal_credentials` and `eth1_withdrawal_credentials` (interop.rs:14,20): Same `as_ssz_bytes()` pattern. Plus 3 test assertions using `v.pubkey.as_ssz_bytes()`.
5. `builder.rs:1466` test: Same pattern.

**Fix**:
- Removed `.to_vec()` from both `impl_display!` and `impl_debug!` macros — pass the array directly to `hex_encode`.
- Replaced `as_ssz_bytes()` with `serialize()` in `get_withdrawal_credentials`, `bls_withdrawal_credentials`, `eth1_withdrawal_credentials`, and test assertions.
- Removed now-unused `use ssz::Encode` imports from `get_withdrawal_credentials.rs`, `interop.rs`, and `builder.rs`.

**Impact**: The Display/Debug macros are used by `GenericPublicKey`, `GenericSignature`, `GenericAggregateSignature`, and their `*Bytes` variants. Every `format!("{}", pubkey)`, `format!("{:?}", sig)`, log statement, or serde serialization of these types previously allocated a Vec (48 bytes for pubkeys, 96 bytes for signatures). In a running node, pubkeys and signatures are logged and serialized frequently (peer discovery, attestation processing, API responses).

**Spec check**: No new consensus-specs commits since run 1212 (latest e50889e1ca, #5004). No new spec test releases (latest v1.7.0-alpha.3).

**Verification**: 37/37 BLS tests, 8/8 EF BLS spec tests, 2/2 genesis tests, full workspace clippy clean (lint-full), pre-push hook passes.

### Run 1215: fix consolidation processing regression (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: CI failure — `electra/sanity/blocks/multi_epoch_consolidation_chain` EF spec test failing with state root mismatch (real crypto only).

**Root cause**: Commit 9cf1e78d5 (run 1201, "avoid cloning entire pending_consolidations list in epoch processing") introduced a semantic bug. The optimization split `process_pending_consolidations` into two passes: first collect `(source, target, balance)` tuples, then apply balance changes. But the spec requires balance changes to be applied **inline** — when multiple consolidations affect the same validator, later consolidations must see the decreased balance from earlier ones. The two-pass approach read all balances before any were modified, producing incorrect results for multi-consolidation chains.

**Fix**: Reverted to single-pass inline processing. The clone of `pending_consolidations` is necessary here because we need immutable iteration while mutating balances. This is one of the cases where the borrow checker correctly forces the clone.

**Bisect**: Used `git bisect` to identify 9cf1e78d5 as the first bad commit (6 steps, ~10 minutes).

**Verification**: 79/79 real-crypto EF tests, 139/139 fake-crypto EF tests, 575/575 state_processing tests, lint clean.

### Run 1214: performance optimization sweep complete (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Searched for remaining allocation optimization opportunities across entire codebase.

**Method**: Comprehensive scan of all production code for:
- `as_ssz_bytes()` on fixed-size types → all converted to `serialize()` in runs 1210-1213
- `to_vec()` on fixed-size arrays → all converted in runs 1204-1213
- `collect::<Vec<_>>()` where iterator would suffice → all optimized in runs 1151-1164
- `hash()` (Vec return) vs `hash_fixed()` ([u8; 32] return) → all using `hash_fixed` already
- `ssz_encode()` → all converted to `serialize()` in run 1212
- Unnecessary clones in hot paths → all optimized in runs 1199-1211

**Result**: No remaining actionable optimization targets in production code. All remaining `collect::<Vec<_>>()` calls are either:
- Required by borrow checker (need to materialize before mutable state access, e.g. `slashings.rs`)
- On complex types without `FromIterator` (e.g. `VariableList` in `block_replayer.rs`)
- In low-frequency paths (once per block/epoch, not per-attestation)
- In test code

All remaining `.clone()` calls are either:
- Required by ownership semantics (API boundaries, channel sends)
- `Arc::clone` (cheap atomic increment)
- Borrow checker constraints (simultaneous read+write)

**Conclusion**: Phase 4 (Performance) is comprehensively complete. Runs 1151-1214 eliminated heap allocations across all hot paths: BLS verification, attestation processing, fork choice head computation, state transitions, gossip processing, merkle proofs, and crypto formatting.

### Run 1216: fix self-build envelope signature verification (2026-03-14)

**Scope**: Spec conformance audit found that self-build envelopes (builder_index == BUILDER_INDEX_SELF_BUILD) had signature verification entirely skipped. Per spec, `verify_execution_payload_envelope_signature` always verifies — for self-build it uses the proposer's validator pubkey instead of a builder pubkey.

**Root cause**: Original implementation assumed self-build envelopes skip verification, based on an incorrect interpretation. The comment referenced a non-existent `is_valid_indexed_execution_payload_envelope` function. The VC already signs self-build envelopes with the proposer's key (correct), but other nodes skipped verifying that signature (incorrect).

**Fix**:
- `execution_payload_envelope_signature_set` (signature_sets.rs): handle self-build by looking up `state.validators[state.latest_block_header.proposer_index].pubkey`
- `process_execution_payload_envelope` (envelope_processing.rs): remove `!= BUILDER_INDEX_SELF_BUILD` guard
- `verify_payload_envelope_for_gossip` (gloas_verification.rs): remove `!= BUILDER_INDEX_SELF_BUILD` guard
- Tests updated: 3 tests changed from "any signer accepted" to "wrong signer rejected", 2 new tests added (empty signature rejected, proposer signature verified in gossip)

**Impact**: Without this fix, any node could forge self-build envelopes with arbitrary payloads for any slot — the empty/forged signature would be accepted. The bid's block_hash commitment provides some protection, but the signature is an additional cryptographic guarantee.

**Verification**: 575/575 state_processing tests, 79/79 EF spec tests (real crypto), 139/139 EF spec tests (fake crypto), full workspace lint-full passes.

### Run 1424: add beacon_fork_choice_store and block_times_cache test coverage (2026-03-15)

**Scope**: Add unit test coverage for two previously untested beacon_chain modules.

**beacon_fork_choice_store.rs** (15 tests):

- `set_time_if_less`: keeps minimum timestamp
- `prune`: removes old entries, no underflow at early slots
- `get_block_delays`/`get_peer_info`: unknown block returns defaults
- Multiple blocks tracked independently
- All `set_time_*` methods create entry if missing

**Verification**: 28/28 tests pass, clippy clean, lint-full passes.

### Run 1425: add fork_choice_signal and events test coverage (2026-03-15)

**Scope**: Add unit test coverage for two previously untested beacon_chain modules.

- `wait_already_ahead`: wait for slot below current returns Success immediately
- `wait_times_out_when_no_signal`: no signal sent → TimeOut
- `notify_out_of_order_returns_error`: slot regression returns ForkChoiceSignalOutOfOrder
- `notify_same_slot_is_ok`: same slot is not strictly less, accepted
- `notify_monotonically_increasing`: 10 increasing slots all succeed
- `concurrent_notify_then_wait`: cross-thread notify wakes waiting receiver
- `behind_when_signaled_lower_slot`: signal slot 3 when waiting for slot 10 → Behind
- `multiple_receivers_all_wake`: notify_all wakes two concurrent receivers
- `default_tx_starts_at_slot_zero`: Default impl starts at slot 0

**events.rs** (16 tests):
- `no_subscribers_initially`: all 21 has_*_subscribers() return false on fresh handler
- `subscribe_block/head/finalized/execution_bid/execution_payload/payload_attestation/execution_proof_received_shows_subscriber`: subscribe creates subscriber
- `drop_receiver_removes_subscriber`: dropping Receiver decrements count
- `register_block/head/finalized_event_received_by_subscriber`: end-to-end register → try_recv
- `register_without_subscribers_does_not_panic`: silent drop when no subscribers
- `multiple_subscribers_all_receive`: broadcast semantics verified
- `capacity_multiplier_scales_channel_size`: multiplier=2 allows 32 buffered events
- `event_routing_independence`: block event not delivered to head subscriber

**Verification**: 26/26 tests pass, clippy clean, lint-full passes.

### Run 1426: add attester_cache test coverage (2026-03-15)

**Scope**: Add unit test coverage for the previously untested `attester_cache.rs` module. Also added `Debug` derive to `AttesterCacheKey` to support test assertions.

**attester_cache.rs** (15 tests):
- **CommitteeLengths** (7 tests): get_committee_count_per_slot bounds check, get_committee_length at slot 0, wrong epoch error, invalid committee index error, all slots in epoch sum to active validators, single validator edge case, epoch 1 boundary
- **AttesterCacheValue** (1 test): get returns correct justified checkpoint and positive committee length
- **AttesterCache** (5 tests): get on empty returns None, insert and get roundtrip, prune_below removes old entries and keeps recent, prune_below zero is noop, insert_respecting_max_len evicts lowest epoch at capacity
- **AttesterCacheKey** (2 tests): equality semantics, inequality on differing epoch/root

**Verification**: 15/15 tests pass, clippy clean, lint-full passes.
